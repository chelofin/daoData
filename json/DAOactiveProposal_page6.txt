(We satisfy all criteria.)\\n* A working product with a strong addressable market and functionality. (We satisfy all criteria.)\\n* A roadmap for growth with no barriers to execution. (We have a roadmap and a clear strategy for growth, but we need to secure investment to really scale up our efforts and grow the team with the view of growing EarthFund into a billion-dollar company.)\\n\\nAnd due to the legal uncertainty of DAOs, the role of the EarthFund DAO was another barrier for investors. \\n\\nAs such, our advisors have recommended establishing a new company\\u200a\\u2014\\u200aEarthFund Inc\\u200a\\u2014\\u200ato own and control the assets and intellectual property of EarthFund. \\n\\nBecause we didn\\u2019t want to remove or reduce the role of the EarthFund DAO in the management of the platform, vetting causes and helping shape the projects/causes on the platform, we came up with the following solution.\\n\\n\\n### **Our proposal for the relationship between EarthFund and the new company**\\n\\nThe management of EarthFund DAO proposes the following:\\n\\n* **EarthFund DAO will seek to raise money** from institutional investors.\\n* **EarthFund DAO will form a new Delaware entity** (\\u201cNewco\\u201d) through which the investment funds will be raised.\\n* The **investment monies will be used to continue the development of the Newco platform** and further market EarthFund\\u2019s solutions.\\n* EarthFund DAO has recently created and launched a DAO launchpad, KYC solution, donation router, grant/rewards contract, token minting tool, Discord bot, and more\\u2026 all of which enable prospective customers to launch a decentralized community without spending months or years developing their own platform.\\n* **EarthFund DAO will contribute assets **(i.e., all intellectual property, including but not limited to brand, platform, and software)** to Newco in exchange for 20% of the equity of Newco.** (The remaining equity in Newco will be allocated to investors and to current and future Newco leadership as an incentive.)\\n* **EarthFund DAO will receive common shares of Newco** with no voting rights except as described below.\\n* EarthFund DAO management believes that the value of EarthFund\\u2019s interest in Newco (i.e., 20%) will far exceed the current value of EF DAO on a stand-alone basis.\\n* EarthFund DAO and Newco will work closely together to maintain a fair ecosystem for DAO communities on Newco\\u2019s platform.\\n* EarthFund DAO will receive quarterly shareholder updates from Newco\\n* **EarthFund DAO will be responsible for the \\u2018Browse Communities\\u2019** section of the Newco platform (what communities are included, featured, removed, etc.)\\n* **EarthFund DAO will be entitled to their pro-rata share of sales proceeds if Newco is sold.**\\n* **EarthFund DAO will receive its pro-rata distributions from the profits of Newco if Newco chooses to distribute profits (vs. reinvest).**\\n* EarthFund DAO will have a vote on how it uses distributions or possible sales proceeds.\\n\\n\\n## **Have your say**\\n\\nVoting to approve this proposal will allow EarthFund to seek the investment it needs to continue growing and developing the platform despite market conditions. \\n\\nIt is our goal to use the investment to grow the EarthFund platform into one of Web3.0\\u2019s biggest companies and aim for these stretch goals in the next 12 months: \\n\\n\\n* launch 1000+ communities\\n* Raise $100M in donations\\n* Facilitate $5M in community rewards\\n* Fund 20K+ world-saving grants\\n\\n### Voting approval can help us make these goals a reality. \\n\\nThank you, as always, for your support. \\n", "proposer":

We also didn\\u2019t want to sell out to the VCs.  \\nSo out of necessity we came up with a new way for funding early stage crypto projects like us.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Fair Funding In Crypto: \\nA project being sustainably funded, with substantial benefits for the early supporters and _no risk of them losing their money_ - built on Alchemix and a Nounsdao concept. \\n- One daily auction for a \\u201cFair Funding Spot\\u201d \\n- The spot carries a significant benefit in the project such as a discount or bonus in the future tokensale, reduced fees or boosted yields \\n- All proceeds from the auction are put into an Alchemix vault. A non-liquidatable, self-repaying loan is then taken out which will be the actual funding going to the project. \\n- The funder/investor retains complete ownership of the original funds and gets back 100% over time! Either paid back early by the projects success, or in a worst case scenario by the self-repaying loan on Alchemix over time. \\n\\nThis significantly reduces the risk profile of contributing funds to an early stage project, yet allows the project to raise in a sustainable way - a fair win/win for all parties. \\n\\nRead more about it [here](https://unstoppabledefi.medium.com/fair-funding-in-crypto-bc88d633646).\\n\\n\\n### Current Status:\\nThe contracts are already about 75% complete. They\'ve been developed fully test-driven with 100% test coverage in Vyper. The core functionality is already in place, what\'s still missing is advanced features like migrating between Alchemix vaults to capture the best yields and an opt-out possibility to self-liquidate since we want offer our users the maximum amount of freedom and don\'t have them locked in (debt positions are fully tokenized and tradeable as well).  \\nWhen complete they will go through our strict internal security process [which we\'ve outlined here](https://unstoppabledefi.medium.com/security-at-unstoppable-finance-bcaad26c628b).\\n\\nAfter that we would want them to be audited by a reputable and competent external auditing team.\\n\\n### Unstoppable:Team\\n![Our Core Team](https://unstoppable.ooo/unstoppable_team.png)\\n\\n\\n## Alchemix Grant\\n**Benefits for Alchemix**\\n\\nThe Fair Funding platform built on Alchemix highlights the new composability of the Alchemix v2 platform with a project that contributes real value to builders and communities in the space.\\n\\nIt will bring volume and new users to the Alchemix platform and showcase the possibilities of building on and with Alchemix.\\n\\n\\n**Usage of Grant**\\n\\nThe primary use of the grant would be to pay for an official audit of the Fair Funding contracts by one of the reputable and competent audit companies. We are already in contact with ChainSecurity who would be our ideal choice and are waiting for a quote. In case ChainSecurity is too expensive, we\'ve already established a relationship with Sherlock.xyz who could be a viable alternative.\\n\\nAny excess funds would be used to support further development of the platform (such as UI) and to spread awareness of the new Fair Funding possibility powered by Alchemix.\\n\\n\\n**Delivery of Grant (in case the proposal passes)**\\n\\nWe are happy to complete the work on the contracts _before_ the grant would be payed out to eliminate execution risk.  \\nWe are also happy to have the Alchemix team escrow the grant funds (or be part of a multisig) to ensure the funds are only used as outlined above.  \\n\\n**Size of Grant**\\n\\nThe scope of the audit would need to cover the three main contracts (Auction, Vault, tokenized position). It should be <1000 lines of code which according to [Sherlocks pricing](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/protocols/audit-pricing-and-timeline) would put it somewhere towards the mid-to-high end of the $15-$38k range. (Vyper pricing is slightly different according to Sherlock).  \\nWe are still waiting on an estimate from ChainSecurity but given that they have a longer track record and have established themselves as one of the best auditing teams out there, we expect their quote to be higher.\\n\\nAnd as we said above, any funds beyond the pure audit cost would be put to good use to make more teams know about and use the Fair Funding platform.\\n\\nWe hope the Alchemix community can help us suggest what a fair amount for this grant would be.\\n\\n\\n### Summary\\nBy supporting this grant request, you would help a young project that\'s determined to add value to the space and establish itself as a good player and you would help expand and ensure the safety of the Alchemix ecosystem.\\n\\n## Voting Options \\nA vote \\"FOR\\" authorizes sending this proposal to the official Alchemix snapshot in its current form, against doesn\'t not authorize sending to the official snapshot:\\n\\n### Voting options if sent to official snapshot:\\n1. For: Audit only (Sherlock) ~1.5-2k ALCX (exact amount determined by Sherlock)\\n2. For: Do it properly - ChainSecurity Audit or Sherlock + dev support ~2.5k-7k (exact amount to be discussed in comments)\\n3. Against: We shouldn\'t fund this at all\\n4. Abstain: I have a better idea (see comments)\\n\\nIf 1+2 have >50% of the vote, the more popular will be executed.\\nIf 3+4 have >50% of the vote, the more popular will be executed.", "proposer": "0xeeec0e4927704ab3bbe5df7f4effa818b43665a3", "proposalCreatedAt": "2022-11-30T02:25:24.000Z", "proposalNativeId": "0xd5df572a36288365c3e752910f148deb20bcb4b96a5bf5f61bf4273b7daea7f4", "endedAt": "2022-12-03T02:25:22.000Z", "status": "ACTIVE", "totalVotes": "11", "choicesMappedToScores": "{\\"For\\":\\"[\\",\\"Against\\":\\"7\\",\\"Abstain\\":\\"2\\"}", "proposalUrl": "https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0xd5df572a36288365c3e752910f148deb20bcb4b96a5bf5f61bf4273b7daea7f4", "proposerProfilePageUrl": "https://deepdao.io/user/0xeeec0e4927704ab3bbe5df7f4effa818b43665a3/verified_dao_experience"}, {"organizationId": "58e67457-7680-4992-b91e-854df4b9eadf", "platform": "SNAPSHOT", "title": "DOGE price prediction for the end of 2022", "description": "", "proposer": "0xb2668aa455d16ceeb90560d70118093d689a410d", "proposalCreatedAt": "2022-08-17T11:39:21.000Z", "proposalNativeId": "0x3883cd78cc9b21cc200a72b2c4e17e8ba33301a3c8fd2930701d9d1208d2d38d", "endedAt": "2022-12-31T04:00:00.000Z", "status": "ACTIVE", "totalVotes": "11", "choicesMappedToScores": "{\\"0-0.01U\\":\\"[\\",\\"0.01-0.025U\\":\\"0\\",\\"0.025-0.05U\\":\\",\\",\\"0.05-0.075U\\":\\"0\\",\\"0.075-0.1U\\":\\",\\",\\"0.1-0.2U\\":\\"2\\",\\"0.2-10U\\":\\",\\"}", "proposalUrl": "https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0x3883cd78cc9b21cc200a72b2c4e17e8ba33301a3c8fd2930701d9d1208d2d38d", "proposerProfilePageUrl": "https://deepdao.io/user/0xb2668aa455d16ceeb90560d70118093d689a410d/verified_dao_experience"}, {"organizationId": "37b8ab4b-dd9b-4cc6-a1f2-f98e4bc7d911", "title": "Send a batch of dispatch calls and atomically execute them.\\nThe whole transaction will rollback and fail if any of the calls failed.\\n\\nMay be called from any origin.\\n\\n- `calls`: The calls to be dispatched from the same origin.

voter\\u2019s wallet\\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/form-aavegotchidao-foundation-with-9-directors-multisig-signers/4551\\nSigprop: https://vote.aavegotchi.com/#/proposal/0xa9fb5cbdeae064bf114b27ea77390e93d8515c6c3512d4352f21e99212628483\\n\\n**INTRODUCTION**\\nAavegotchiDAO was summoned as a 100% on-chain DAO in September 2020 via the deployment of the GHST bonding curve. Since then, the DAO has matured into one of the world\\u2019s most active with over forty successful AGIPs passed and extremely healthy metrics on Snapshot. Over this period we also graduated across our DAO\\u2019s roadmap, going from DAO 1.0 into the more experimental period known as Cocoon, our precursor to Metamorphosis (AKA DAO 2.0). Achieving Metamorphosis requires the DAO to further decentralize and accept more responsibilities currently guarded by the original summoners and Pixelcraft Studios.\\n\\nToday we propose the next major step forward by suggesting it is time for AavegotchiDAO to add an off-chain presence to our decentralized autonomous organization. The following proposal is rooted in months of research and interfacing with a variety of legal advisors. We also take the practices of leading peers such as ENS and Sushi into consideration, opting for Foundation formation in the Cayman Islands coupled with on-chain governance being secured as primary via the Foundation\\u2019s Constitution.\\n\\nRead on to see how we may move AavegotchiDAO forward in a way that drives progress for our vision of an open-source, on-chain gaming protocol!\\n\\n**PROPOSAL**\\nMy proposal is for us to form the AavegotchiDAO Foundation in the Cayman Islands as soon as possible by following these steps:\\n\\n1. AGIP 51 is simultaneously live to elect 9 Directors/multisig signers. The results of this election will only be applied if this CoreProp to form the Foundation passes.\\n\\n*Hear from all of the applicants for Directorship at our Discord\'s \\u201c#DAO Entity Signaling Thread\\u201d under #Dao-forum.\\n\\n2. Submit the nine fully KYC\\u2019d, elected Directors details to our legal counsel from LEX DAO so that they can immediately begin Foundation formation. \\n\\n3. Upon formation of the Foundation, the Directors shall create the new Foundation\\u2019s primary multisig using Gnosis.\\n\\n4. Pixelcraft Studios shall transfer DAO Treasury multisig funds to the Foundation multisig, including DAI, GHST, and Alchemica on both Ethereum and Polygon networks.\\n\\n5. The Foundation is thus formed, ready to execute transactions according to the will of AavegotchiDAO. Further definitions of responsibilities, scope, goals and limits can be defined by the DAO at a later date.\\n\\n**FOUNDATION DETAILS**\\n**Entity**\\n- A Cayman Islands foundation with a board consisting of 9 Directors, who are also the multisig signers of the DAO Treasury wallet.\\n\\n- Legal Counsel shall arrange a local officer to act as secretary fulfilling basic administrative requirements until further notice.\\n\\n- Legal Counsel shall arrange a local corporate secretarial service to assist with Foundation formation, documentation and production of financial statements.\\n\\n**DAO Treasury**\\n\\n- All DAO treasury funds present and future shall be transferred to the Board\\u2019s multisig.\\n\\n- The GHST Bonding Curve Council tokens could potentially also be transferred to the multisig signers, via a new AGIP proposal.\\n\\n- Eventually, all protocol contracts could be owned by this multisig, or if that is deemed not ideal, could be owned by the DAO itself (onchain voting) with the Board multisig action as a last resort Guardian to prevent malicious transactions.\\n\\n**Bank Account**\\nUpon formation of the Foundation, legal counsel will confer with our corporate secretary to establish a Cayman Island\\u2019s bank account on the Foundation\\u2019s behalf. While not immediately useful, we have requested that this bank account be opened so as to futureproof the DAO to be able to natively settle any off-chain expenses (tradfi subscription fees, service providers, etc).\\n\\n**Board of Directors**\\n- Consists of nine doxxed Directors that also act as multisig signers on the DAO Treasury multisig. The DAO Treasury multisig shall be set at 5/9 signers in order to execute.\\n\\n- Paid position starting at 8000 GHST per year, paying 2000 GHST to each Directory directly from the Treasury multisig every 90 days.\\n\\n- The Board acts as the executor of the DAO\\u2019s wishes. If individual Directors disagree with an action of the DAO, they can choose to resign but they cannot vote or act against a verified on-chain AGIP\\u2019s intent.\\n\\n**The Officer**\\nThe Foundation also requires at least one Officer to serve an official capacity for signing off-chain documentation. Legal offers a package to deliver one local Officer to fulfill this role. This is not a role for advocacy so this Officer will simply execute signatures at the direction of the Directors. Of course, AavegotchiDAO can always revisit or even expand Officer roles at any point.\\n\\n**The Constitution**\\n- Legal Counsel will draft and supply a first version of a Constitution that takes best practices from fellow DAOs into consideration. Counsel will submit this Constitution in the form of a Google Sheet with comments turned on for our community to give feedback and suggest changes.\\n\\n- Counsel and the DAO shall go back and forth in up to three drafts before the Constitution is sent to Snapshot for a three-day CoreProp regarding ratification.\\n\\n- If ratification fails, another two drafts shall be edited before re-submitting for another CoreProp vote. This process continues until a ratification of the Constitution is achieved.\\n\\n- The Consitution Ratification shall require 66%+ support once ready for CoreProp (no Sigprop). \\n\\n**ROADMAP  (Estimated and updated since Sigprop)**\\nNow - Nov 21: DAO Discussion Forum + Signaling *(PASSED)*\\nNov 21: 3 Day Sigprop on whether or not to incorporate\\nNov 27: 7 Day Coreprop with elections\\nDec 5 - DAO Foundation directors confirmed/elected\\nDec 17 - DAO Foundation officially launched with 9 directors\\nDec 18 - DAO Treasury multisig transfers to the Foundation\\nQ2 2023 - Diamond Contracts transfer to Foundation\\n\\n**Benefits of Formation**\\n- Independence; greater separation of Pixelcraft Studios from AavegotchiDAO\\n- Board can execute proposals on behalf of the DAO (Liquidity provision, GHST staking, funding Dework, etc.)\\n\\n**Risks of Formation**\\n- More responsibility on AavegotchiDAO governance\\n- More exposure to any future policy shifts specifically in the Cayman Islands jurisdiction\\n\\nJoin the conversation in the forum and be sure to review those applying to serve as Directors in AGIP 51 as well. \\n", "proposer": "0x5e31c357d03e9528e9bf95bd16e5c1ab3f7d37d0", "proposalCreatedAt": "2022-11-27T11:29:03.000Z", "proposalNativeId": "0x345ddec87f19d29b438ac88d0f947798af6edadbe1116cb64f96edc931f06fb3", "endedAt": "2022-12-04T14:00:00.000Z", "status": "ACTIVE", "totalVotes": "10", "choicesMappedToScores": "{\\"YES, let\'s form the Foundation!\\":\\"[\\",\\"NO, this ain\'t it! \\":\\"1\\"}", "proposalUrl": "https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0x345ddec87f19d29b438ac88d0f947798af6edadbe1116cb64f96edc931f06fb3", "proposerProfilePageUrl": "https://deepdao.io/user/0x5e31c357d03e9528e9bf95bd16e5c1ab3f7d37d0/verified_dao_experience"}, {"organizationId": "37b8ab4b-dd9b-4cc6-a1f2-f98e4bc7d911", "title": " Approve a proposal.
