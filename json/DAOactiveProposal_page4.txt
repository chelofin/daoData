The scene is pre-customized to profile look and feel and then deployed into Decentraland.\\nInstaverse is a great tool for anyone who wants to create a Decentraland presence, regardless of their skill level.

This will allow keeping their \\"spaces\\" online, similar to hosting websites in classic web20 hosting business.\\nAs we have a verbal agreement with the number of landowners, we are going to start with free of charge model to attract more users.\\n\\n### Instaverse Tower\\n\\nIt is a new skyscraper scene in Decentraland that will offer an affordable space for everyone at a lower price. This is a great entry point for creators/businesses to opportunity to get involved in the Metaverse. Creators can use this space to reach a wider audience.\\nIn future plans, we have a vision to have multiple towers as a scalable solution.\\n\\n### For Landowners\\n\\nLandowners can make money by leasing out their land to Instaverse and use a subscription-based system. In this system, users pay a subscription fee that allows them to use the land to host a scene. The landowner makes money from the subscriptions that are paid each month.\\n\\n### Long term vision\\n\\nIn the future, we will expand our services to work with other social networks like Facebook (Facebook pages), LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, ArtStation, Behance, and websites to create a rich and easy-to-use experience for metaverse integration.\\n\\n\\n## Specification\\n\\n### Private Residence\\n\\nA 1x1 private space generated based on Instagram profile.\\n\\n![proccess-1](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/scene-proccess.jpg)\\n![proccess-2](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/scene-proccess2.jpg)\\n\\n**Space customization includes:**\\n\\n*   Pictures gallery from Instagram feed\\n*   The Stable Diffusion AI models will generate unique textures based on the profile data.

This will allow providing services for about 150 owners per one spot. This will save on renting/buying land, construction costs and get beautifully designed space. In the future, it opens a variety of others gamified in exciting ways that would include all participants and their guests.\\n\\n### System architecture\\n\\n![System architecture](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/system-flow.jpg)\\n\\n### We are going to build architecture with the following modules:\\n\\n1.  **Parser** - Instagram profile scraper. We need to make sure we respect the platform restrictions.\\n2.  **Color picker.** This module will figure out the main 3 colors in Instagram profile based on avatar, highlights, feed.\\n3.  **AI texture generator.** Based on the main color from Instagram profile, we use Stable Diffusion which is open source and specially trained model to generate textures. Example.\\n4.  **Scene assembler.** The user data (links and pictures) is applied to a 3D scene.\\n5.  **Deployment module.** We are going to create automating deployment scripts. At DAPPCRAFT we already have DevOps scripts in place. We\'re going to reuse them and adapt in this project.\\n\\n***\\n\\n### SCENE DEMO\\n\\n[![preview](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/video-preview.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3nAbzjpSYT8)\\n\\n\\n## Personnel\\n\\n**Total team: 10 members:**\\n\\n*   CEO, Johnny Kartakov (LinkedIn)\\n*   Chief Metaverse Officer/Product Manager, Demian G (DAPPCRAFT co-founder & CEO)\\n*   COO, Dmitry Gladky (COO DAPPCRAFT)\\n*   3D Lead, Chris N.,\\n*   3D modeling - Ayrat Abdullaev\\n*   System Architect, Sergey Drobashenko\\n*   Front-end developer, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Alexander Mikhutkin\\n*   Front-end developer, TypeScript - Vlad Rytov\\n*   Backend developer, Python - Andrey D.\\n*   DevOps, automation & monitoring - TBD\\n*   Quality Assurance Engineer - TBD\\n\\n**Budget**\\n\\n*   Team compensation: $16 600 per month or a total of $99 600\\n*   UI/UX (external team): $4600\\n*   Servers cost for 12 months: $7400 (~$500/month with GPU support server, ~$120/month web server stack)\\n*   Operational budget: $4800\\n\\n\\n## Roadmap and milestones\\n\\nMilestone #1: 28 of February 2023.\\n\\n*   Landing page with 3 steps.

Each with their own tools, dapps, communities, founders, developers and financial ecosystems. A lot of these projects are building stuff that can be integrated into decentraland.\\\\\\n\\\\\\nLater this month I will be doing an event to showcase https://talisman.xyz\\n(A non-profit metamask alternative that can already be used to log in to decentraland and access polkadot and ethereum data at the same time.. *-Drops mic-* )\\\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/coinatomy/status/1594690826617200642/\\n\\\\\\n\\\\\\n**How this benefits Decentraland?**\\\\\\nOver the next couple of months I will be hosting events for individual parachains. DCL will receive more attention from the polkadot community resulting in more active users through organic marketing and more tools being built for decentraland. Polkadot has around 15,000 active developers and I plan to reach out to as many as possible, to see if they are interested in contributing..\\nI\'ve been involved in polkadot since 2016 and developed good relationships with a lot of polkadot/kusama brands. But with a new ecosystem being added every other week it is becoming hard to keep up with all the developer activity. So I want to bring them all together and show them why decentraland is the best metaverse on the market.\\\\\\n\\\\\\n**So what have we BUITL so far?**\\\\\\nUNO (Which I will opensource)\\\\\\nA Quiz system for inputting/approving/viewing questions..\\\\\\nMaze (Ready for some paintball?)\\n\\n\\n## Specification\\n\\n**What we want to build next?**\\\\\\n**1.** So we want to allow cross chain transactions in-game from polkadot. This is considerably harder than polygon because most of polkadot is not EVM compatible. So our plan is to build a substrate pallet that can be added to an existing parachain like a piece of lego. Then we can work with the talisman code to build a kinda dot-connect (similar to the widely popular eth-connect) which should allow polkadot transactions in-game.\\\\\\n**2.** The quiz we\'ve **BUITL** is a really good tool for education. I would like to get all of the dot communities to submit good questions and answers about their projects so that we can expand the consciousness of education. Things we would like to include are; NFTs, games, competitions, leaderboards and more. Sure, we\'re open to suggestions.\\\\\\n**3.** Paintball\\\\\\n**4.** Once the above is completed we want to start working on a polkadot L2 in-game marketplace!\\n\\n\\n## Personnel\\n\\n**Who?**\\\\\\n*Butter#4840* - Been promoting DCL since launch. Doing events on my own since May 2020. With the most notable being Keep Networks hackathon in Sept 2020 which received 2.2m views from 50,000 unique addresses.. Since then I\'ve been doing smaller events for individual companies and projects.\\\\\\n*Binh* - WSS/Backend stuff. Can build anything.\\\\\\n*Max* - Graphic designer recently aquired. \\\\\\\\\\n\\n\\n## Roadmap and milestones\\n\\n**Budget?**\\\\\\nCurrently I\'ve spent about $25k on the quiz and UNO.\\\\\\nAnd it will take about $30k to build a substrate pallet and dot-connect.\\\\\\n\\\\\\n**Why proposal?**\\\\\\nAs you can see we\'re hitting new development milestones every day. Up until now I have been paying for everything myself. Cross-chain transactions is something that everyone will benefit from and it doesn\'t make sense to have to pay for everything myself.\\\\\\n\\\\\\n**So let\'s get it BUITL!**\\\\\\nhttps://BUITL.com\\n\\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1c5a5390-69a7-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598)**", "proposer": "0xbb7b59afa3a0e5be143b8fe9c641f00c1ecb9d69", "proposalCreatedAt": "2022-11-21T14:16:38.000Z", "proposalNativeId": "0x6e0c7e6e21516dc86cf52a838a03e6202db4c2dbeb350465dd19124144b21399", "endedAt": "2022-12-05T14:16:00.000Z", "status": "ACTIVE", "totalVotes": "65", "choicesMappedToScores": "{\\"yes\\":\\"[\\",\\"no\\":\\"4\\"}", "proposalUrl": "https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0x6e0c7e6e21516dc86cf52a838a03e6202db4c2dbeb350465dd19124144b21399", "proposerProfilePageUrl": "https://deepdao.io/user/0xbb7b59afa3a0e5be143b8fe9c641f00c1ecb9d69/verified_dao_experience"}, {"organizationId": "da9956dc-8a87-40c0-a066-b8991d67e574", "platform": "SNAPSHOT", "title": "My offer for Optimistic Ape Yatch Club", "description": "Optimistic Ape Yacht Club is not a copy and an attempt to snatch a hype or be similar, but a turning point in the history of derivatives on $OP.

Users and landowners in decentraland will benefit directly from this proposal. We offer 75+ unique build designs that can be used by everyone in decentraland.\\n\\n\\n## Specification\\n\\nPros to Decentraland:\\n\\nThe owner of a parcel can start some activity without the hassle of building a structure.\\nThis proposal will revitalize dead lands and increase engagement as it would be a hassle-free process to deploy scenes/ builds.\\nThese builds can be used by several creators who are doing events and need a better build.\\nThe builds will include 1x1, 2x1, 2x2 (Clubs with SDK), offices, headquarters, NFT Galleries, and 3x3 event spaces, and concert stage.\\nThis will lead to more engagement on the platform since there will be multiple active scenes.\\n\\n*Monetary Benefits to Decentraland:*\\n\\nIt will be up to the community to decide how to distribute the builds for this part, We can vote on the following options. We will conduct a separate poll to decide what the community wants.\\n\\nPoll Option 1: To make these builds completely public and accessible to everyone.\\n\\nPoll Option 2: Make the builds available as NFT collections so users can buy them for a nominal charge $20, $30 $40 & $50 from Opensea and all profits go to the DAO treasury address.\\n\\nJob opportunity: There will be a need to add logos, place NFTs, and make minor/major changes to the build. We will be selecting individuals from within the community who are able to work on the 3D models so they can edit these builds for individuals and projects with Dhingia Builds and can earn an income.\\n\\nBuild Features:\\n\\nBuilds will have striking and distinctive designs.\\nDecentraland norms and specifications will be followed when building.\\nBuilds will have various size options.\\nBuilds will have the facility of light, interiors and elevators.\\nBuilds can be customised using DCL builder.\\nBuilds will be within triangle limits and SDK friendly.\\nBuilds will have perfect collisions and layout for movement.\\n\\nBuilds are fully functional and can be customised by USER based on an individual\'s needs and project requirements. Comes with an instruction video \\u201cHow to deploy the scene?\\u201d. We will provide a series of videos detailing how to place the build on land, install other GLB files, assets, and other general SDK features to make the build more functional. Also, the videos for editing the Game.ts and Scene.json files and setting up the build for deploying on the land parcel. A special discord and website will be developed for distributing these builds to the community\\n\\nApart from making these 75+ builds and assets, Dhingia Builds pledges to help 10 projects/Individuals with custom (upto 2 parcels) free builds who add value to Decentraland which We have done earlier too, so We wish to continue the same. It could be educational institutions, religious organizations, NGOs or individual creators in need of builds. Anyone can apply for the Custom Build with the idea and how it will bring value to Decentraland.\\n\\n\\n## Personnel\\n\\nMr. Dhingia Personal: I Joined DCL in Nov 2021, I\'m a Decentraland builder. I own Dhingia Club (144,-148) and build 3D architecture for commercial and personal use in Decentraland and other metaverses. Through Dhingia club we\'ve hosted many events including birthday parties, cultural events, and launch parties for builds. I publish wearables, and actively engage with the DCL DAO on a daily basis. I often gift builds to individuals who contribute to DCL\'s success. I also actively spread the word about metaverse and give out merch at IRL events like XVERSE, a Decentraland collaboration at Gitex Global, World Trade Center, Dubai, UAE and others.\\n\\nSocials:\\n\\nWebsite - www.mrdhingia.com\\n\\nEmail - contact@mrdhingia.com\\n\\nInstagram - www.instagram.com/mrdhingia\\n\\nTwitter - www.twitter.com/MrDhingia\\n\\nDiscord - MrDhingia#6908\\n\\nInterview by DCL report Maryana https://youtu.be/dMJJraTbkVQ\\n\\nFeatured in Digital trends link https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/clubbing-festivals-in-metaverse/\\n\\n\\n## Roadmap and milestones\\n\\nAdditionally, 5 builds will be made available immediately by Mr. Dhingia for the community when the proposal is passed after the voting process.\\nFive builds will be released each month.\\nAs these structures/builds are developed, they will be displayed in District X, Decentraland\\n\\nIf the platform supports builders, it will be highly appreciated.

With metaverses and gaming experiences evolving towards full Virtual Reality (VR)  we investigate potential effects of this transition. Virtual reality and sports will continue to grow recreationally, professionally, and medically, however biomedical research has yet to evaluate the impact of this new VR technology, as ethical and health concerns arise. This grant provides a scientific investigation of potential dangers and benefits of VR integration into the metaverse. Our expert teams of Medical Practitioners, Researchers and Decentraland community members seek to answer these questions.\\n\\n\\n## Grant size\\n\\n60,000 USD\\n\\n## Beneficiary address\\n\\n0x0A05A8A135E3D1F035819daDb4484f74b104A346\\n\\n## Email address\\n\\ninfo@npact-village.com\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nWe spend an increasing amount of our daily life in the digital environment. This is not a new thing, but the ability to meet social, work, educational, cultural, and even IRL maintenance without ever leaving your computer exploded in post-covid. With this explosion of work from home coupled with tradition gym closures and technologically leverage products like Peloton reaching mass adoption, the future partnership of exercise and the metaverse finally moved beyond its perpetually nascent phase.\\n\\nTo say it has reached full adoption, or is technically proficient as desired, would be taking great liberty with the truth. However, while the technology is lagging, the social structure of sports, includes its competitive nature, are taking subtle but significant steps. Beyond a traditional leader board displaying a name and temporary high score, individualized avatar athletes provide recognition, branding, and the under pinning of the tribal mentality associated with sports rivalries.\\n\\nDigital uniforms and team names and identities which under tradition are regionally formed, with specialized equipment and sponsorship following, has been turned on its head. In contrast, factors including time zones, preferred equipment, technological compatibility and political affiliations are component parts of the whole. While not the focus of this project, these factors must be considered during any ethical design review process. As these factors could lead to over exertion and injury in any environment, we will endeavor to identify and isolate their direct impact on the metaverse based virtual gaming environment.\\n\\nAs discussed above, home exercise has moved leaps and bounds from aerobic types of yesteryear. Now, instead of being led by the recording, we are now recording the leader. However, that leader is not always human and classes give way for competition on a more regular basis. Without the unpredictability of inclement weather, cost of ravel, ongoing communication, and generally large time commitment associated with organized sporting events, more frequent and bespoke functions are possible.\\n\\nRanging from a group of friends virtually cycling together to an esports arena teaming with thousands, virtual reality and sports will continue to grow recreationally, professionally, and medically. Biomedical research and implementation while quite conspicuous with the Invictus games, the impact of tech many not be as obvious in character design and movement. For example, at one of the most simple designs, an underwater adventure game, while perfectly safe for the human behind the goggles, would spell destruction if replicated in the real world. While seemingly far-fetched and low-hanging fruit as an example, it speaks to a potentially increasing problem, realism in avatar function and design. Even the greatest suspension of reality would have difficulty reasonably finding a gamer trying to fly off a building as a dragon. But could the same be said for a human gamer trying to imitate a Tetris style climbing game in the real world if digitally designed? In light of the multiple injuries suffered each year in pursuit of social media challenges like the mild crate climb, these risks become increasingly foreseeable. Simply put, as the likeness to human increases in avatar, does the risk of injury though imitation on competition simply increase?\\n\\n\\n## Specification\\n\\n### Research question\\n\\nTo what degree, if any, does an omnidirectional sporting device and combination with virtual reality increase the risk of injury to the participant?\\n\\n### Sub Questions\\n\\n1.  To what degree, if any, does the underlying physical condition of a participant contribute to risk?\\n2.  To what degree if any are risks associated with physical condition mitigated or warned against by manufactures?\\n3.  To what degree of commonality, if any, will new omnidirectional related injuries occur?\\n    What are the most likely injuries?\\n4.  To what degree, if any, does the environmental design of the game enhance risk of injury?\\n5.  To what degree, if any, does the design and functionality of the avatar enhance risk of injury?\\n\\n### Hypothesis\\n\\nIt is our belief that game designers did not properly anticipate the incongruity of digital physical capabilities in design, resulting in participants mimicking unnatural actions or the avatar or game requirements resulting in new sports injuries patterns or occurrences.\\n\\n### Design\\n\\nUtilizing the Kat VR Omnidirectional system in conjunction with the Oculus Rift, our participants will engage in gaming and digital sports, captured on video. Following 10 sessions to allow familiarity and ease, our lead physician researcher will review the kinetics, identify the greatest points for risk of injury. This will be correlated with the gaming interaction for design review. Following processing and correlation of all data, the highest and most common risks will be identified for further study and to offer precautions to the community at large.\\n\\n### Methods\\n\\n1.

Chicken Bonds are a novel derivative built on top of liquity that organically builds protocol owned liquidity. Due to the similarities of liquity and beanstalk (namely, protocol native organic yield), we think that beanstalk would be a suitable stablecoin protocol to build chicken bonds on.\\n\\nMultiple roles will be needed to launch a MVP: \\n\\n#### (Essential) Smart Contract Development: \\nCurrently being developed by Brean and Co.. Coop plans to utilize the ROOT token in order to accelerate development. Current progress is here: https://github.com/Brean0/Beansprout-Coop \\n\\nCompensation: 0 Beans will be transferred upon completion.\\n\\n#### (Essential) Front End Development: \\nA web3 Frontend is needed in order to create, view, and interact with the coop bonds. This needs to be composable with both circulating and farmer balances, as well as beanstalk and root. Pipeline can be used to massively improve UX experience (for example, swapping USDC to BEAN, depositing into the silo, minting ROOT, and depositing into a coop bond, all in one transaction).\\n\\nCompensation: 15,000 Beans will be transferred upon completion.\\n\\n#### (Non-essential) UX Development:\\n\\nA good UX design would help facilitate adoption of coop bonds. \\n\\nUX Development is labeled \\u201cNon-essential\\u201d as someone could do both frontend and UX design, as well as utilize available UIs from chicken bonds.\\n\\nNote: \\u201cNonessential\\u201d does not mean \\u201cnot required\\u201d, but \\u201cnot mandatory\\u201d for an MVP. Brean and Co will determine in a project timeline that development has progressed to a point where UX changes would delay the project significantly. \\n\\nCompensation: 10,000 Beans will be transferred upon completion.\\n\\n\\n#### (Non-Essential) NFT Artwork: \\n\\nThe Coop bonds will implement on-chain dynamic svg NFTs. Current implementation design is here. https://github.com/Brean0/Beansprout-Coop/blob/main/image.png. While this is enough for an MVP, the coop is open for alternative designs. The design must be able to be generated on chain, without the need of a separate contract.\\n\\nNote: \\u201cNon-Essential\\u201d does not mean \\u201cnot required\\u201d, but \\u201cnot mandatory\\u201d for an MVP. Brean and Co will determine in a project timeline that development has progressed to a point where UX changes would delay the project significantly. \\n\\nCompensation: 5,000 Beans will be transferred upon completion.\\n\\nUpon deployment of the coop contracts, the remaining unspent beans will be given to the protocol to bootstrap (it will be allocated to the permanent pool, meaning the deposit is forfeited and the yield will permanently be given to bROOT holders). \\n\\n## Security\\n - Chicken bond audits (Coinspect + Dedaub)\\nhttps://github.com/liquity/ChickenBond/tree/main/LUSDChickenBonds/audits\\n - Beanstalk Farm plans to allocate an audit stream for the COOP. \\n\\n### Risks\\n\\n- Chicken Bonds are a new and novel implementation, and (at least in beanstalk) has not been tested in the real world. The nature of open-source opens the door for exploits in bugs, flaws, and errors. \\n- Coop plans to utilize an upgradeable proxy and a multisig with beanstalk and root community members to enact changes on the will of the token holders, as well as emergency changes. \\n\\n## Future work\\n- Pending chicken bonds could theoretically be used as collateral to borrow BEAN/ROOTs. \\n- Analytics can be developed on both the Coop NFT and bROOT token. \\n- bROOT/ROOT or bROOT/BEAN could be whitelisted in the silo for stalk rewards, omitting the need for a 3% fee on Chicken In to incentivize liquidity. \\n- Discussion on align liquity and the coop. Examples include:\\n     - Participating in governance to push for a BEAN:LUSD pool. \\n     - Allocating a portion of ROOTs in the permanent pool and swap for BEAN:LUSD LP\\n- Discussion on utilizing ROOTs in permanent pool beyond the native yield\\n    - Market making on paradox\\u2019s parimutuel bets.\\n    - Purchasing pods on the market.\\n    - (requires fungible stalk) exchanging stalk for bean, at times of excess demand, or exchanging beans for stalk at times of excess supply. \\n\\n## Effective \\nUpon passage of this BSP, 90,000 Beans will be sent to the Coop address.\\n\\n", "proposer": "0xf9d183af486a973b7921ceb5fdc9908d12aab440", "proposalCreatedAt": "2022-12-01T16:33:37.000Z", "proposalNativeId": "0x44b39b42454e5b50e1da4fb28f2cc2645a4206434debf1109707efc7c741d5ca", "endedAt": "2022-12-06T18:00:00.000Z", "status": "ACTIVE", "totalVotes": "51", "choicesMappedToScores": "{\\"For\\":\\"[\\",\\"Against\\":\\"7\\"}", "proposalUrl": "https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0x44b39b42454e5b50e1da4fb28f2cc2645a4206434debf1109707efc7c741d5ca", "proposerProfilePageUrl": "https://deepdao.io/user/0xf9d183af486a973b7921ceb5fdc9908d12aab440/verified_dao_experience"}, {"organizationId": "da9956dc-8a87-40c0-a066-b8991d67e574", "platform": "SNAPSHOT", "title": "Hello , i from Ukraine", "description": "**i stay without work , because is war now , please give me some cake for life - 0x1a5FB1b850F6f12274Eb50B78175123f5D999044\\n,i have family and 1 child ,\\nmy telegram @ErPanasov\\nif you have work to me  please give some massage -  holydidman@gmail.com \\n**", "proposer": "0x1a5fb1b850f6f12274eb50b78175123f5d999044", "proposalCreatedAt": "2022-11-01T14:12:39.000Z", "proposalNativeId": "0xa4abc0d69ddb0d95dbf00ebbae451997248c75d39f8a4a7a02416ae6de38c2b0", "endedAt": "2022-12-30T21:00:00.000Z", "status": "ACTIVE", "totalVotes": "51", "choicesMappedToScores": "{\\"Donate!\\":\\"[\\",\\"I understand you ,man!\\":\\"2\\"}", "proposalUrl": "https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0xa4abc0d69ddb0d95dbf00ebbae451997248c75d39f8a4a7a02416ae6de38c2b0", "proposerProfilePageUrl": "https://deepdao.io/user/0x1a5fb1b850f6f12274eb50b78175123f5d999044/verified_dao_experience"}, {"organizationId": "da9956dc-8a87-40c0-a066-b8991d67e574", "platform": "SNAPSHOT", "title": "Yes go gogo..!!", "description": "hallo devloy good luck , salam to the moond...", "proposer": "0xafd72d89debfc85f1f28e2c8d95e4d2ecf0f2572", "proposalCreatedAt": "2022-10-22T16:09:02.000Z", "proposalNativeId": "0x0c65bddf7f4200240c2f23f0a4aad5253da95bfb7b16aefb560fc7716a1622b2", "endedAt": "2022-12-21T17:00:00.000Z", "status": "ACTIVE", "totalVotes": "51", "choicesMappedToScores": "{\\"I love you \\":\\"5\\"}", "proposalUrl": "https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0x0c65bddf7f4200240c2f23f0a4aad5253da95bfb7b16aefb560fc7716a1622b2", "proposerProfilePageUrl": "https://deepdao.io/user/0xafd72d89debfc85f1f28e2c8d95e4d2ecf0f2572/verified_dao_experience"}, {"organizationId": "1c4e506b-114e-4008-87ac-ab083f1ea3fb", "platform": "SNAPSHOT", "title": "HYP-IP 1: Governance Guide", "description": "Welcome to HYP.GOV\\nThis space is an interim on chain voting system that will provide the HYP community a localised Governance system to further the protocol and community.\\n\\nFor now if you have a proposal idea \\ud83d\\udca1 make it well known in the HYP discord forum.\\n\\nOnce you have rapport in the forum a GM will hold a vote to list the proposal here.\\n\\nVotes here will last 5 days in order to prototype rapidly.\\n\\nSee the choices below on how to set up your choices in your proposal.\\n\\nWe appreciate you as community members and would like to encourage you to make yourself as busy as possible in the community forum to spread your ideas while maintaining comms in discord to gain support.", "proposer": "0x569dc48e090e5fe72bc83c6fbdceca8a8aa82bd9", "proposalCreatedAt": "2020-12-28T04:22:09.000Z", "proposalNativeId": "QmRwFUM2or1cQPK4Vm3RPqHmpuCU4v2LwfAg2NW9emwtSx", "endedAt": "2024-01-02T17:00:00.000Z", "status": "ACTIVE", "totalVotes": "50", "choicesMappedToScores": "{\\"\'Yes\', (with explanation)\\":\\"[\\",\\"\'No\', (with explanation)\\":\\"0\\",\\"\'Other\', (with explanation)\\":\\",\\"}", "proposalUrl": "https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/QmRwFUM2or1cQPK4Vm3RPqHmpuCU4v2LwfAg2NW9emwtSx", "proposerProfilePageUrl": "https://deepdao.io/user/0x569dc48e090e5fe72bc83c6fbdceca8a8aa82bd9/verified_dao_experience"}, {"organizationId": "60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece", "platform": "SNAPSHOT", "title": "Service for expeditious brands transfer to Decentraland", "description": "> by 0xa21de68ec34bc163cb1b84504419aa82c73ca8dd (Anaplays)\\n\\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\\n\\n## Abstract\\n\\nWe are launching the first service for moving brand collections to DCL for digital fashion enthusiasts and contributors. Our service will simplify creating digital collections from physical ones and immediately transfer them to DCL. The entire procedure for one collection will take a maximum of one week (our goal is a few days) and will replenish the DCL market with a large quantity of fashionable and high-quality wearables at affordable prices.\\nSeamm is a mobile app that stores and transfers digital collections to metaverses and video games. The current stage of development includes the feature transfer to DCL. Our team requires resources to optimize the speed of digitizing brand collections and publishing them on the DCL marketplace.\\n\\n\\n## Grant size\\n\\n60,000 USD\\n\\n## Beneficiary address\\n\\n0x0F8a07Cd05AA48fBB5aBEd5EaEfBcA8AF49b5B4C\\n\\n## Email address\\n\\npartnership@seamm.io\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nBrands desire to sell and market their garments and accessories in DCL, but frequently lack the knowledge and resources to do it quickly and effectively. Players in Decentraland desire to be able to purchase and wear trendy and cool wearables in DCL, however the marketplace\'s existing selection of wearables is characterized by sporadic, restricted releases from brands and generally prohibitive pricing. Our service will assist in bridging the gap between businesses and their audiences in order to enrich the material for the DCL marketplace and promote digital collections of brands with minimal effort.\\nBrands will obtain a new channel for the quick and professional distribution of their fashion collections, while the DCL community will have access to a diverse selection of high-quality content (wearables and accessories) at a reasonable price.\\n\\n\\n## Specification\\n\\nWe will construct more integration with the DCL API using the subsequent processes and combine it with the existing mobile application. To start we\\u2019ll work with three brands for\\nProcesses:\\n\\n*   Create a collection\\n*   Collection moderation\\n*   Transfer\\n    The project will involve the development of a server application and database to hold digital collections of brand names. We have already signed contracts with seven brands willing to digitize one item from their collections for inclusion in our initiative.\\n    The finished solution will contain all required production-ready features, such as data security and encryption, as well as, if necessary, at least two server applications operating for failover/redundancy.\\n    The first phase of the project will concentrate on server construction, 3D modeling (7 items), and UI/UX design,  while the second phase will involve integration with DCL API (or a possible way to connect directly).\\n    The objective is to expand the number of brands with wearable collections and content and to generate greater market activity by offering a vast selection of outfits and accessories.\\n\\n\\n## Personnel\\n\\nWith a team from the fashion, technology, and gaming industries, Seamm cultivates a space to create, experiment, and release inhibitions.\\nThe software engineers that have already published two versions of our core application will be a part of the new service development team. The UI/UX designer has a portfolio of successful fashion brand projects. Our 3D artists have launched wearables collections on the DCL marketplace for brands and have experience creating 3D models that adhere to constraints and optimize all needs. Business Development - 20+ years in the fashion industry (e.g., Bottega Veneta, Moschino, TSUM).\\nOur crew is intimately familiar with the challenges that every brand has while designing collections for DCL. As players in DCL, our team members are familiar with the frustrations of consumers when the market for wearables is limited. Therefore, we are prepared to resolve this issue and propose a universal answer for both parties.\\n\\n\\n## Roadmap and milestones\\n\\nPhase 1 features:\\n\\n*   Collecting technical requirements for DCL API integration\\n*   UI/UX design and features\\n*   Creation of 3D-models (7 items)\\n    Total estimated time: 80 hours\\n    Phase 1 extra features:\\n*   Approve collection\\n*   Implementation of comments and fixing in the interface\\n\\nTotal estimated time: 20 hours\\n\\nPhase 2 Features:\\n\\n*   Transfer process and approve\\n*   Integration with DCL API\\n*   Publishing in the DCL marketplace\\n\\nTotal estimated time: 40 hours\\n\\nTotal Project Estimated 140 hours\\n\\nDev budget 40k\\nDesign and 3D-artists budget 20k\\n\\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=79869460-6a34-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598)**", "proposer": "0xbb7b59afa3a0e5be143b8fe9c641f00c1ecb9d69", "proposalCreatedAt": "2022-11-22T07:08:33.000Z", "proposalNativeId": "0x018e0b06a3aeb9f6ffd5cbbcb42203b895d28181ec4e7a7f67478efbdb7b5c36", "endedAt": "2022-12-06T07:08:00.000Z", "status": "ACTIVE", "totalVotes": "50", "choicesMappedToScores": "{\\"yes\\":\\"[\\",\\"no\\":\\"2\\"}", "proposalUrl": "https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0x018e0b06a3aeb9f6ffd5cbbcb42203b895d28181ec4e7a7f67478efbdb7b5c36", "proposerProfilePageUrl": "https://deepdao.io/user/0xbb7b59afa3a0e5be143b8fe9c641f00c1ecb9d69/verified_dao_experience"}, {"organizationId": "e2839abc-9982-4ef7-b57b-01bee5d0710b", "platform": "SNAPSHOT", "title": "\\u5bb6\\u4eba\\u4eec\\u4eca\\u5929\\u9001\\u4e86\\u591a\\u5c11\\u5355\\uff1f", "description": "", "proposer": "0x0b7b8c32a3e52fee150e078a9ed014ab3eedcc7b", "proposalCreatedAt": "2022-10-15T07:07:26.000Z", "proposalNativeId": "0xa217ac7321d26006d59cc3d21bdfa5f60d46ae27c5032c609a172f91cccd8c4f", "endedAt": "2023-01-31T04:00:00.000Z", "status": "ACTIVE", "totalVotes": "50", "choicesMappedToScores": "{\\"15\\u5355\\u4ee5\\u4e0b \\":\\"[\\",\\"25\\u5355\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\":\\"2\\",\\"35\\u5355\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\":\\"4\\"}", "proposalUrl": "https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0xa217ac7321d26006d59cc3d21bdfa5f60d46ae27c5032c609a172f91cccd8c4f", "proposerProfilePageUrl": "https://deepdao.io/user/0x0b7b8c32a3e52fee150e078a9ed014ab3eedcc7b/verified_dao_experience"}, {"organizationId": "da9956dc-8a87-40c0-a066-b8991d67e574", "platform": "SNAPSHOT", "title": "MetaDUC is bullish ! ! !", "description": "This is a big project plus I am one of the managers of this project and a Swedish team is behind this project moreover it can be ready to fly.\\n\\nThis project is a metaverse project and it is building its own metaverse.

SuperVerse DAO governance empowers $SUPER token holders by letting them have a say in the future of the project. To make this a successful process, it is critical to have active participation from all of the members of the DAO. We rely on community initiative to thrive in idea submission, general feedback, proposal submission, and voting. Transparency is a guiding value for the SuperVerse DAO and with that in mind, all parts of the governance process will be visible to the DAO members.\\n\\n**Membership Eligibility:**\\n\\nThe only requirement for membership in the DAO is staking $SUPER token within the designated DAO pools on the SuperVerse website. Staking $SUPER token allows participation in proposal ideation, general community discussion, and voting on proposals. Participating in proposal submission is restricted to SuperVerse DAO members that stake at least 15,000 $SUPER within the designated DAO pools.\\n\\n**Guidelines**\\n\\n1. Every year, there is a DAO-wide vote to determine which DAO members will serve on a special council for the SuperVerse DAO (the Special Council). The purpose of the Special Council is to administer DAO proposals and serve the vision of the community.\\n2. A Special Council member may be removed and replaced prior to the term pursuant to a majority vote of token holders. \\n3. The total cost of implementation must be clear in order for a proposal to get voted on.\\n4. DAO members must search past proposals to ensure any idea they intend to write a proposal for has not already been submitted.\\n5. If a suggested proposal is in direct conflict with a proposal that is currently up for a vote, the second proposal should not be voted on until a decision is made on the first proposal to avoid approval of opposing requirements.\\n6. A suggested proposal that is in direct conflict with another approved proposal cannot get voted on for three months after the original proposal has been implemented to avoid wasting community assets.\\n7. Proposals will not be considered or put up for a vote if they involve illegal activity, hate speech, pornographic material, or are at odds with the mission or values of the SuperVerse DAO.\\n\\n**The Process**\\n\\n**Proposal Phases**\\n\\nPhase One: SVIP Idea\\n\\nAn idea is submitted by the community as a post in the forum. The person or persons submitting the SVIP idea are the SVIP Authors. More than one DAO member can work on an SVIP idea, but it should only be submitted once. The community then has the opportunity to provide feedback via comments on the forum. The SVIP Authors can propose changes to the original idea, but only through comments on the forum. To keep discussions transparent, the SVIP Authors may not change the original post.\\n\\nPhase Two: SVIP Draft\\n\\nWhen SVIP Authors determine they have enough information to draft a proposal, an admin engaged by SuperVerse will close the topic on the forum and send the proposal template to the SVIP Authors along with the next steps for submission. The SVIP Authors should consider including any community feedback that furthers the idea as part of their draft before continuing. The admin may inform the SVIP Authors of any necessary changes required to comply with the DAO-approved guidelines. At this time, an  SVIP Author will be required to authenticate their wallet to prove they have met the staking requirements for submitting a proposal. If the SVIP Authors do not respond to all requests from the admin within 30 days, the SVIP draft will be automatically rejected. If and when the admin confirms the SVIP draft complies with the DAO-approved guidelines, a number will be assigned to the SVIP for identification purposes. From that point on, the SVIP is referred to as \\u201cSVIP-#; (Name) - (Category)\\u201d. For example, this first SVIP is \\u201cSVIP-1: Proposing the DAO - Process and Informational\\u201d.\\n\\nPhase Three: SVIP Analysis Report and Moderation\\n\\nThe SVIP Draft is reviewed by an admin team engaged by SuperVerse. The admin team will analyze the proposal and provide a report detailing costs, steps to implement, legal considerations, third-party review requirements, potential conflicts of interest, and any further complications that have been identified. Knowing that some SVIP Authors may be submitting drafts with little to no resources, this phase is important to ensure that DAO members have enough information about proposals to make informed decisions when voting. During this time, the admin team also decides if the proposal adheres to the DAO-approved guidelines. If approved, it becomes a Pending SVIP and moves to Phase Four. If not approved, it is eligible for resubmission except in extreme circumstances. SVIP\'s that violate the law, include misleading information, or have reasonable suspicion of fraud will not be eligible for resubmission.\\n\\nPhase Four: SVIP Designation\\n\\nPending SVIPs that have passed SVIP Moderation are designated as \\u201cReady to Vote\\u201d or \\u201cNeeds Administrative Review\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cReady to Vote\\u201d designation is given to a pending SVIP whose details meet the proposal criteria and are of no risk to the well-being of the DAO. Any Pending SVIP that is designated as \\u201cReady to Vote\\u201d will go to the board for final approval. If final approval is given by the board, skip to Phase Six. In a case where the board does not approve the Pending SVIP, clear rationale will be provided to the SVIP Authors of the proposal and the proposal will be eligible for resubmission.\\n\\nThe \\u201cNeeds Administrative Review\\u201d designation is given to a Pending SVIP whose costs, content, or implications are considered complicated or a potential risk to the well-being of the DAO. Any Pending SVIP that is designated as \\u201cNeeds Administrative Review\\u201d must go through Phase Five.\\n\\nPhase Five: SVIP Admin Review (If Applicable)\\n\\nFor Pending SVIPs that have been designated as \\u201cNeeds Administrative Review,\\u201d the Board will determine whether clarification or action is required before moving a Pending SVIP to Phase Six. If clarification or action is not needed, the Pending SVIP is designated as \\u201cApproved for Voting\\u201d and proceeds to Phase Six. If the Board decides to return a Pending SVIP for further clarification or action, they must provide a clear explanation of why and designate it as either \\u201cReturn for Clarification\\u201d or \\u201cReturn for Reconstruction.\\u201d\\n\\nReasons to tag as \\u201cReturn for Clarification\\u201d may include, but are not limited to:\\n\\n* The cost to implement is unclear or not able to be calculated\\n* The proposal would use more than 5% of the DAO treasury\\n* The proposal conflicts with another proposal\\n\\nReasons to tag as \\u201cReturn for Reconstruction\\u201d may include but are not limited to:\\n\\n* The proposal conflicts with the mission and values of the DAO\\n* The proposal is at odds with the well-being of the DAO\\n* Violations of law, or against the advice of counsel for Super Foundation\\n* Reasonable suspicion of fraud or other misleading information\\n\\nPhase Six: SVIP Vote\\n\\nDrafts that have passed their respective approval processes will go live for voting on Snapshot. Once live on Snapshot, SVIPs are open to voting for six days. SuperVerse admins are the only ones that can post SVIPs to the voting tool, because they must confirm that each one has gone through the correct approval process.\\n\\nPhase Seven: SVIP Determination\\n\\nIf a live SVIP vote has not received the minimum engagement of 5% of the circulating supply of $SUPER or at least 60% of the total votes \\u201cin favor\\u201d of the proposal, it will be designated as \\u201cStalled\\u201d and be eligible for Resubmission. In all other cases, SVIPs are moved to one of two Final SVIP categories. Rejected Final SVIPs can be resubmitted via the appropriate Resubmission Template if the SVIP Author contacts an admin. Accepted Final SVIPs move into SVIP Implementation.\\n\\nPhase Eight: SVIP Implementation\\n\\nFor Accepted Final SVIPs, implementation will begin based on the steps outlined in the SVIP template. The admin engaged by the Super Foundation is responsible for ensuring this happens, but is not responsible for doing it themselves.\\n\\nProposal Conflicts\\n\\nIf a suggested proposal directly conflicts with a proposal that is currently up for a vote, the second proposal should not go for a vote until a decision is made on the first proposal to avoid approval of opposing requirements.\\n\\nA suggested proposal that directly conflicts with another approved proposal cannot go to vote for three months after the original proposal has been implemented to avoid wasting community assets.\\n\\n**Specifications**\\n\\nThe SuperVerse website is home to all things for the SuperVerse DAO. The website is the access point to all relevant information such as the SuperVerse DAO governance process and all the systems or tools that are part of the SuperVerse DAO ecosystem. \\n\\nCommunication Channel: The forum platform (Phase One)\\n\\n* SVIP Idea posts must be approved by an admin to ensure they meet all predetermined guidelines and template requirements.\\n* All posts and comments will be regularly monitored by both an admin engaged by the SuperVerse DAO and by the DAO community members themselves.\\n* The SVIP Authors of an SVIP idea share their idea via a post in the forum and cannot edit the original post. If the SVIP Authors want to propose changes to the original SVIP Idea, the SVIP Authors must do this via the comments.\\n* Once SVIP Authors determine they have enough information for a proposal, SVIP Ideas threads are closed to community feedback and will be locked by an admin.\\n\\nProcess for SVIP Draft Submission via SVIP Template: (Phase Two)\\n\\n* Once an SVIP Idea is locked in the forum, after the community feedback period, an admin will contact the SVIP Author to provide the appropriate SVIP Template.\\n* The SVIP Author should then submit an official SVIP Draft to the admin using the SVIP Template.\\n* The admin may then continue communication with the SVIP Author to inform them of any incorrect or missing information that needs to be changed\\u2014or clarifications that need to be made\\u2014 for the SVIP Draft to move to the next step.\\n* If the SVIP Author does not respond to an admin\\u2019s request to change, update, or make clarifications on the SVIP Draft within 30 days, the SVIP Draft will be automatically rejected.\\n\\nPlatform where live SVIPs are Hosted: Snapshot (Phase Six)\\n\\n* SuperVerse DAO members must go through a wallet authentication process to vote on Snapshot.\\n* SuperVerse admins are the only ones allowed to launch SVIPs on Snapshot, as they must ensure each SVIP has gone through the correct approval process.\\n* See SVIP-2 for further details on the proposed SVIP Vote mechanics.\\n\\n **Steps to Implement**\\n\\n* Complete setup of forum and settings\\n* Assign administrators of the forum\\n* Assign reviewers to prepare reports for implications of proposals\\n* Assign admins to review proposals\\n* Assign special council\\n* Set up Snapshot space\\n* Whitelist admin wallets to submit proposals\\n* Create custom token-gating solution for the forum\\n* Add Wallet Connect support to the token-gating solution for the forum\\n\\n **Timeline**\\n\\nAll steps have been prepared and are ready to be implemented.\\n\\n **Overall Cost**\\n\\nSuperVerse DAO will provide a kitty to bankroll the initial costs of the DAO to a value of $250,000.00. This will be used to cover domain purchases and related costs, legal fees, DAO administration setup, forum platform maintenance, and miscellaneous out-of-pocket costs. This will also be used to hire resources (admins) to operate the DAO for the first 12 months.", "proposer": "0x3ff4a23987100c7af2bcc003e45b039e4ad69270", "proposalCreatedAt": "2022-11-29T19:48:36.000Z", "proposalNativeId": "0x7730e987eef9fcf4f34ffa26206957c8b8cb9a55bfaeb6c01b2fd4a27ded22f9", "endedAt": "2022-12-05T20:00:00.000Z", "status": "ACTIVE", "totalVotes": "47", "choicesMappedToScores": "{\\"In favor\\":\\"[\\",\\"Against\\":\\"2\\"}", "proposalUrl": "https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0x7730e987eef9fcf4f34ffa26206957c8b8cb9a55bfaeb6c01b2fd4a27ded22f9", "proposerProfilePageUrl": "https://deepdao.io/user/0x3ff4a23987100c7af2bcc003e45b039e4ad69270/verified_dao_experience"}, {"organizationId": "6fff2925-9a44-4161-bae5-14c921851155", "platform": "SNAPSHOT", "title": "Is Aztec protocol only applicable to zk.money?", "description": "Is Aztec protocol only applicable to zk.money?\\n\\n", "proposer": "0x74b02eb9acfa1e85ac555e0dc09cd68d61a3433d", "proposalCreatedAt": "2022-08-14T03:12:50.000Z", "proposalNativeId": "0xbe42372d1ac194a4f1db0b6bfbdf6bbdef9cb958a7437a65caa4044df9d13eb3", "endedAt": "2023-05-29T04:12:50.000Z", "status": "ACTIVE", "totalVotes": "46", "choicesMappedToScores": "{\\"yes\\":\\"[\\",\\"no\\":\\"2\\"}", "proposalUrl": "https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0xbe42372d1ac194a4f1db0b6bfbdf6bbdef9cb958a7437a65caa4044df9d13eb3", "proposerProfilePageUrl": "https://deepdao.io/user/0x74b02eb9acfa1e85ac555e0dc09cd68d61a3433d/verified_dao_experience"}, {"organizationId": "da9956dc-8a87-40c0-a066-b8991d67e574", "platform": "SNAPSHOT", "title": "The Original Cakestar/ \\"OC\\" (not to be confused with \\"OG\\") NFT Pancake Bunnies Utility For Value Enhancement Makeover!!!", "description": "Allow for (any or all) NFT Pancake Bunnies too:\\n\\nA.

voting protocol for the DAO outlined in SVIP-1. Snapshot.org will be used initially for voting on improvement proposals. Proposals that have followed the respective guidelines and have been approved will be available for voting on Snapshot.\\n\\n**Community Incentive:**\\n\\nThe goal of this proposal is to create voting infrastructure for SuperVerse DAO members to participate in the decision-making of the DAO. That is why Snapshot is proposed as the voting tool for the SuperVerse DAO. The benefits of the proposed voting system are:\\n\\n* not requiring a gas payment\\n* ensuring transparency\\n* expanding governance participation to all SuperVerse DAO members\\n\\nWithout a voting system in place, arriving at a consensus on proposals would be centralized, with only a few people holding decision-making abilities. This proposal aims to avoid this result.\\n\\n**Rationale:**\\n\\nAs the ecosystem evolves and expands, a well-defined system is required to gather new community ideas and provide a clear path for these ideas to be approved for implementation. A proposal process is foundational to this system becoming a reality. This proposal outlines a voting tool that seeks to balance the pros and cons of various voting approaches and to hold up the core of the SuperVerse DAO\\u2019s guiding values. This voting tool can be found below in the following specifications section.\\n\\n**Specifications**\\n\\nAssuming SVIP-1 is approved, implement Snapshot as the voting tool for the SuperVerse DAO where:\\n\\n* Only SuperVerse DAO members may vote\\n* New SVIPs that meet the required guidelines will be put to a community vote\\n* The voting opens immediately upon posting and is open for six days\\n* The voting options for a live SVIP are \\u201cIn favor\\u201d and \\u201cAgainst.\\u201d Voting \\u201cIn favor\\u201d means the voter is in favor of implementing the SVIP exactly as-is. Voting \\u201cAgainst\\u201d means the vote is against implementing the SVIP exactly as-is \\u2014 one may vote \\u201cAgainst\\u201d to encourage the SVIP Author to resubmit the SVIP after making changes.\\n* If a live SVIP Vote has not received the minimum engagement of 5% of the circulating supply of $SUPER or at least 60% of the total votes \\u201cin favor\\u201d of the proposal, it will be designated as \\u201cStalled\\u201d and be eligible for Resubmission\\n* Proposals that are approved by the members of the DAO are implemented by the SuperVerse DAO\\n* Only SuperVerse admins can post SVIPs to Snapshot because they must ensure that each one has gone through the correct approvals process\\n\\n**Steps to Implement**\\n\\n* Complete setup of the forum platform and settings\\n* Purchase ENS domain\\n* Create specific space on Snapshot\\n* Implement ecosystem-specific voting strategy\\n* Set administrator addresses\\n* Set voting rules\\n* Set restrictions in Snapshot so that only admins can launch proposals\\n* Open ratification of SVIP-1 and SVIP-2\\n\\n**Timeline**\\n\\nAll steps have been prepared and ready to be implemented\\n\\n**Overall Cost**\\n\\nNo cost to implement", "proposer": "0x3ff4a23987100c7af2bcc003e45b039e4ad69270", "proposalCreatedAt": "2022-11-29T19:51:58.000Z", "proposalNativeId":

With the market sentiment shifting, it is imperative the chimp family is all on the same page about the progression of the project.\\n\\nWe need everyone to vote between both options.\\n\\nOPTION #1 - CONTINUAL FAITH THROUGH THIS MARKET: The current cryptochimpz team will continue to run all day to day efforts to grow the project. We realize we have stepped away for a bit, the truth is we have been through alot, from convincing our silent investor for the rolls Royce, countless legal issues, setting up the $APEcoin claim platform, funding literally 10s of thousands of dollars worth of giveaways, finding new and creative ways to involve our chimp family, and now getting hit with this absolutely nasty bear market. We recognize that the project hasn\\u2019t been clear skies but it is hard to steer ourselves in the right direction with these endless roadblocks mixed with the market sentiment and our community losing faith in us. The one thing we can say is our vision is alive and although we aren\\u2019t as active we will find ways, successful or not, to try and propel this. \\n\\n\\nPlease note we want what will be best for the community, even if that means passing the project off to the community. Should that be the final decision from the community, which we suspect is, we will still play a role because we want to take a role in the chimp fam flourishing. \\n\\nOPTION #2 - PASSING THE PROJECT TO THE COMMUNITY: The CryptoChimpz Team will hand off the project to someone (individual or collective) in the community and step down to - lesser involved advisory roles. We do need to be clear about the structure should this option be most voted. \\n\\n\\u2043\\tThe individual or group of individuals chosen to take over the project will be chosen by our team for the protection of the community. We will choose the new operators from #bod and make sure they adhere to a strict criteria to mitigate any risks transferring ownership comes with.\\n\\u2043\\tThe new operator or operators are free to change the structure of this project. We do however want most larger decisions to be made as a community. \\n\\u2043\\tTo help support the community we will allocate some funds for marketing. We will be transferring these to the new operators of the project. The new operators will be responsible for utilizing these funds to propel the project. 28% of all secondary sales will be withheld and paid out to our silent investor, the remainder will be transferred to the new operators upon which they can utilize funds in ways they see best.\\n\\u2043\\tAll social media accounts will be transferred to the new operators.\\n\\u2043\\tThe founders roles after successful transfer will be discussed with the new operators. Regardless of what roles we help with, the founders will be on standby for any questions or issues the new operators may have.\\n\\nPlease cast your vote by DEC 18th 2022\\u2026 \\n\\nOption #1 = Current Structure\\n\\nOption #2 = New operators/owners with freedom to use funds contingent upon permission of community, the founders will play advisory roles.", "proposer": "0x00e16567a895a9dcadf3e8688350fc86d4b87be6", "proposalCreatedAt": "2022-11-28T01:25:43.000Z", "proposalNativeId": "0xf3b9596120009308bbb2943110ed65916bb60f733fa80b55bab13ed3c74a6e0e", "endedAt": "2022-12-06T05:00:00.000Z", "status": "ACTIVE", "totalVotes": "35", "choicesMappedToScores": "{\\"Option 1 \\":\\"[\\",\\"Option 2\\":\\"2\\"}", "proposalUrl": "https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0xf3b9596120009308bbb2943110ed65916bb60f733fa80b55bab13ed3c74a6e0e", "proposerProfilePageUrl": "https://deepdao.io/user/0x00e16567a895a9dcadf3e8688350fc86d4b87be6/verified_dao_experience"}, {"organizationId": "da9956dc-8a87-40c0-a066-b8991d67e574", "platform": "SNAPSHOT", "title": "World Cup Football", "description": "Users can bet with each other on the champion of tournaments or other games", "proposer": "0xa720bfd56c96a378711cb2e9c9d3263a8ffd93f3", "proposalCreatedAt": "2022-11-26T21:43:55.000Z", "proposalNativeId": "0x1b2315b473fc3383a6bed27560e8f0c380ceded40a6a39a3d15da7b453723d6a", "endedAt": "2022-12-15T00:00:00.000Z", "status": "ACTIVE", "totalVotes": "35", "choicesMappedToScores": "{\\"Agree on\\":\\"[\\",\\"Against\\":\\"8\\"}", "proposalUrl": "https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0x1b2315b473fc3383a6bed27560e8f0c380ceded40a6a39a3d15da7b453723d6a", "proposerProfilePageUrl": "https://deepdao.io/user/0xa720bfd56c96a378711cb2e9c9d3263a8ffd93f3/verified_dao_experience"}, {"organizationId": "1e693922-1380-4b87-af0f-6ab6ca25f37a", "platform": "SNAPSHOT", "title": "Buy more Fairsafe?", "description": "Should I buy more Fairsafe?", "proposer": "0xe5a13716c696eac11c8dfbe1038a8532b6c82dcf", "proposalCreatedAt": "2021-04-24T03:22:30.000Z", "proposalNativeId": "QmbjKnzQnZS8oimQ6Xh7hqxRAN3k6DsZdoqkFju29vSuqX", "endedAt": "2031-04-23T19:00:00.000Z", "status": "ACTIVE", "totalVotes": "35", "choicesMappedToScores": "{\\"Yes\\":\\"[\\",\\"Absolutely\\":\\"1\\",\\"To the moon!\\":\\"1\\"}", "proposalUrl": "https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/QmbjKnzQnZS8oimQ6Xh7hqxRAN3k6DsZdoqkFju29vSuqX", "proposerProfilePageUrl": "https://deepdao.io/user/0xe5a13716c696eac11c8dfbe1038a8532b6c82dcf/verified_dao_experience"}, {"organizationId": "da9956dc-8a87-40c0-a066-b8991d67e574", "platform": "SNAPSHOT", "title": "Mini game section (play to earn but money is generated from the players themselves)", "description": "simple mini games like racing karts , snake or ping pong.
