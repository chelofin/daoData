20,10a8e1fc-d2e3-4d01-8067-0a1606108498,SNAPSHOT,DAO Genesis Committee Formation,"The ssv.network DAO was established last year. Since its inception, the DAO has managed to self-organize and lead strategic projects on behalf of the community, such as the DAO partner program, contributor onboarding, and committees.

The next big challenge is to define a sustainable future mode of operation for the DAO.

For this, the DAO has assembled a ‘DAO Genesis Committee’ (dGC). The committee links the needs of the community, the protocol core team, and the DAOs token holders. Also, the dGC is in charge of organizing and overseeing the DAO.

## dGC responsibilities
The committee will pursue the following goals for the DAO:

* **Define a governance and operation framework**
* **Create a roadmap to decentralization and growth**
* **Execute on that roadmap**

### DAO Governance
The dGC will update the community regarding DAO’s decisions, the use of treasury, runway, protocol development, and other relevant concerns.

To do this efficiently, the dGC will structure and establish a governance and operation framework, along with good reporting mechanisms, to facilitate transparency between the DAO and its stakeholders.

### Roadmap to decentralization and growth
The dGC works alongside the protocol core team to define the DAO’s vision, mission, and goals and develops a path to the DAO’s independence and long-term sustainability.

While working on a plan to get there, the dGC will identify areas of uncertainty and define the necessary measurements to investigate and gain the necessary insights to make informed decisions. To progress, the dGC might initiate appropriate working groups and assign expected outcomes and dedicated compensation models.

### Execution
During the first month, the committee will focus on executing the [Multisig Committee Formation proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth/proposal/0x8d371fcb59779644f7016f5237ba5ff67a8c3622041d0cd04aa7ffd29e2d8fee) and ensure its effectiveness. Also, the committee will lead and oversee the already established Grants Committee (GC) and Operator Verification Committee (VOC) by making their work transparent to all stakeholders, formalizing the current goals, onboarding additional members, hardening and documenting existing processes, and identifying areas of future improvements and required resources.

In preparation for long-term sustainability, the dGC derives a minimum viable governance and operational framework for the DAO, its committees (long-lasting), and working groups (temporary), which includes:

* Why, How, and When to generate new committees and working groups
* Define the relationship between groups and the dGC
* The group leader’s responsibilities, reporting, and accountability
* Compensation model for leaders and members along with operational budget
* On- and off-boarding procedures and guidance for member diversity and qualification
* And more…

## Genesis structure

### dGC initial formation
The initial dGC consists of 6 members, of which 1 member is assigned as the program lead and one member of Blox represents the protocol core team’s point of view. The Committee’s initial mandate will last 6 months. A public vote is required to continue the existence of the dGC after that period ends. The committee lead is appointed every 6 months by the same public vote. dGC members are appointed by the dGC lead or by a community vote.

The initial formation includes the following members:

The dGC Lead is an organizational role that drives the initiative, and is accountable for executing the committee’s mandate:

* Manage and organize committee meetings
* Assist in scoping committee member’s roles
* Assist in scoping working group leader’s roles
* Publish a monthly ‘state of the DAO’ progress report on the forum
* Participate in community calls and represent the DAO
* Assists with setting up working group leaders’ targets, and reporting standards
* Cooperate with working group leaders to create goals and track progress
* Develop related governance and operation procedures
* Work with the protocol core team, the members and external agencies to define a roadmap to decentralization, vision, and mission for the DAO

The dGC lead will be accountable to deliver on the following execution plan:

#### Month 1
Coordinate and help define the DAO’s governance and operation framework. Improve transparency and reporting standards; provide state of the DAO updates, treasury use, and runway. Present grant issuance and progress.

#### Month 2
Ensure working group lead assignment, role definition, goals, and reporting.

#### Month 2-6
Oversee the ongoing operation of committees and working groups. Transitioning the DAO’s focus according to the “roadmap to decentralization”. Define roles and responsibilities moving forward, and present a long-term plan.

## dGC Compensation

### dGC lead
The Genesis Committee lead’s compensation will be 10K USD per month in SSV tokens.

The compensation covers all the work for the dGC and working on any number of existing or newly created committees or working groups without getting any extra compensation.

### dGC member
The Genesis Committee members’ compensation will be 3K USD per month in SSV tokens.

The compensation covers all the work for the dGC as part of the dGC mandate. Above that, a member can participate in other committees or working groups and get compensated according to the group’s compensation model.

### Backdated compensation
The dGC members assumed their role at the beginning of April 2022. They were not compensated for their work thus far. The committee compensation will backdate to start in April 2022. The first installment due to the Genesis group will include the months leading to this proposal’s execution. The backdated compensation will be calculated at 3K USD in SSV tokens per committee member, with no distinction between a member and a lead.

### External services budget
The DAO treasury will allocate a 55K USD budget to the dGC. The dGC will use that budget to obtain external consulting services to help accomplish its mandate. In case a third-party agency is onboarded, the work scope, fees, and deliverables will be transparently shared with the community.

### Total budget
Maximum budget for 6 months, assuming this proposal is effective December 2022, including backdated compensation and external agency budget.

| Member     | Monthly ($) | Total ($) | Unit | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Lead | 10,000 | 60,000 | SSV |
| Member | 3,000 | 18,000 | SSV |
| Member | 3,000 | 18,000 | SSV |
| Member | 3,000 | 18,000 | SSV |
| Member | 3,000 | 18,000 | SSV |
| Blox | 0 | 0 | N/A |
| Backdated | 3,000 | 105,000 | SSV |
| External |  | 55,000 | SSV or USDC |
| Total |  | $292,000	 |  |

The SSV token price will be calculated according to the DAO standard; 90-day closing price average in the previous months.

### Compensation distribution
Every month, the ‘master of coin’ will post a payment request under this proposal. The request will include total allocations for all team members, including reference calculation and external consulting services if any. The Backdated compensation will be executed right after this proposal is passed.

### On/off-boarding
Changes in the dCG structure can be achieved in one of the following ways:

* DAO vote
* Genesis Committee majority vote; 4 of 6 members at current state

Removing or adding a dCG member will require a public vote. The vote will be followed by an official announcement in Discord and the forum. The protocol core team can change its representative at any time with the support of a dGC majority vote. Any change must then be announced on the forum.

24,62ebf9b1-75bb-44ab-8650-14b5656f89fb,SNAPSHOT,USDC Reward for providing liquidity in the WLD /USDC pool,"80% of the big case payout goes to WLD hodler and 20% will stay in the treasury.

Proposal: 

Open the liquidity pool for everyone after the treasury receives the award. Take 10% (but limited to max. 5mio $) of the amount from the big case and distribute it on a daily basis over a year to the people which provides liquidity in the pool. (would be +13700$ per day over a year if the full 5mio$ can be taken)

Calculations:

- the full 1 070 000 000$ or more can be claimed.
  WLD treasury receives 214mio$
  10% are 21,4mio$ but we take max. 5mio$ for LP rewards.
  5mio $reward over a year means that we have 100% apr on the pool when the TVL of the pool is 5mio$. I expect after time the pool apr will shrink down to 30% or even less apr. This would mean that the TVL of pool is around 18mio$ which is 20x more then now and you still get 30% apr if you provide liquidity in the pool. At the current price of WLD around 700mio WLD would be needed which would drive the demand and price of WLD drastically.

- 250 000 000$ can be claimed.
  WLD treasury receives 50mio$
  10% are 5mio$ bo we take the whole 5mio$ for LP rewards.
  5mio$ reward over a year means that we have 100% apr on the pool when the TVL of the pool is 5mio$. I expect the same as above after time the pool apr will shrink down to 30% or even less apr. This would mean that the TVL of  pool is around 18mio$ which is 20x more then now and you still get 30% apr if you provide liquidity in the pool.At the current price of WLD around 700mio WLD would be needed which would drive the demand and price of WLD drastically.

- 50 000 000$ can be claimed.
  WLD treasury receives 10mio$
  10% are 1mio$ so we take the whole 1mio$ for LP rewards.
  1mio$ reward over a year means that we have 100% apr on the pool when the TVL of the pool is 1mio$. I expect the same as above after time the pool apr  will shrink down to 30% or even less apr. This would mean that the TVL of  pool is around 3,6mio$ which is 4,5x more then now and you still get 30% apr if you provide liquidity in the pool. At the current price of WLD around  140mio WLD would be needed which would drive the demand and price of WLD.

Advantage of this proposal:
- more liquidity means the price is more stable and less p&d behavior
- you can buy/sell bigger amounts without moving the price by yourself
- drives the demand for WLD and rewards the people who contribute inn the 
  WLD ecosystem actively and not only passive WLD hodler
- volume will increase because bigger orders can be executed in a bigger pool,    
  this will help to get listed on other exchanges.
- due to the fact that the reward is in USDC and not in WLD there is no inflation 
  of the token and even more buy pressure will occur when people start to 
  compound their LP rewards
- people wont sell their WLD that easy when they know they can get a nice 
  additional apr on them even after the snapshot and the big payout
- I expect that this proposal will drive the price of WLD upwards which will 
  generate publicity and FOMO and can attract new people and investors and 
  maybe brings us in the TOP 100 crypto projects.
- WLD hodler can provide liquidity really easy because they have already WLD 
  + USDC from the payout in their wallet.

Disadvantage of this proposal:
- in a very worse case where the case payout is not that big the full 10% needs to be taken and only 10% would be left in the treasury.
- proposal needs to be renewed after the first year because people will leave the pool if no rewards get paid out anymore. The DAO needs to find a way in this  first year to fund future rewards for the liquidity miner (except the case payout was really big)

if  we don't like the numbers (for example 10% or 5mio or something) but like the idea in general we can propose this proposal again with other numbers if this is the reason why it did not passed the voting.

Beside DCL Report’s Arabic stream, there’s next to no Arabic content about DCL, neither in media where people can learn about DCL, nor educational content to guide new users through DCL’s ecosystem.

While Arabic is the 5th most spoken language on earth, and MENA residents account for 12.5% of all humans, there is no dedicated language or regional channel for Arabs on DCL’s Discord.

Solution

We will create and publish a package of educational content on DCL in Arabic, launch an Arabic channel on DCL’s Discord, and provide support to new joiners from the region.

Team

We produced 5 videos in Arabic about DCL & metaverse. Our team includes the first Arab DCL Reporter.

*The proposal was revised in accordance with received feedback
