2,26f4cf85-41c8-4158-a3bf-7fc2ededb7a3,SNAPSHOT,"Kryptoria DAOMaker Vote $10,000 Prize Pool","Kryptoria was recently accepted into the final shortlist for DAO Maker, one of the biggest and most trusted launchpads in Web3. THIS IS A HUGE DEAL. üöÄ 

They love what we‚Äôre building and want to help launch Ellerium, our token. Whether or not DAO Maker take Kryptoria on is dependent on a community vote. They use voting activity as the main metric for project strength. üìà

It‚Äôs up to everyone here: team, community, partners to get this over the line. ü§ù 

ü™ô ü™ô ü™ô There is potentially a $10,000 allocation of Ellerium to be split between everyone who votes if (and only if) DAO Maker accept us. It‚Äôs in your hands. ü™ô ü™ô ü™ô 

Vote page is open for the next 5 days. To vote:

1) Go to https://daomaker.com/company/kryptoria
2) Connect your wallet and click vote. DAO Maker will also give your wallet a score, based on value of assets. The higher the score, the bigger your share of the $10,000. 
3) Refer people to the page, follow DAO Maker and Kryptoria on Twitter, and visit their research page to increase your score. You can go back every 6 hours to increase your score and, thus, your share.
4) CONNECT YOUR OTHER WALLETS TO VOTE AGAIN
5) Get everyone you know, your grandparents, neighbours, kids to vote‚Ä¶ if they have a wallet, they can vote and receive their share of the $10,000 of Ellerium. 

The team will be sending out daily reminders that the vote is live, for the next 6 days. There will also be a Tweet going out (to be added to this message) that will have DOUBLE CRP points for engagement on it.

31,2d6a743b-c9ca-41cd-bb30-55774ad8bf4a,SNAPSHOT,Develop a Mini Game for the DAO,"0.5 Eth to develop a mini game for Koda Capital. The game will be built out by ProxLabs. 

ProxLabs has decided to front the DAO the 0.5eth so that we can get the game development going asap. In return, any funds made after the DAO is able to max stake our Kennel will be paid back to ProxLabs until the 0.5eth has been paid back in full. 

Game could take 3-7 days to complete

Game will be very similar to Doodle Jump. It won‚Äôt be token gated meaning anyone can play. In order to be eligible for the weekly prizes players must purchase keys.  Every month keys get reset meaning players must use their keys within 30 day period. So If game goes live Day 1, and someone buys keys on day 10, they will only have 20 days to use their keys before they are reset. 

As players progress through the level they will have an opportunity to get free keys aka more free attempts to play.
 
Purchase Packages:
5 keys- 2 ape
10 Keys- 3 ape
20 keys-  5 ape 

Total buy-in Pool will be split with 50% going to DAO, other 50% going towards game prize pool. 

1st place: 70% of prize pool 
2nd place: 20% of prize pool 
3rd place: 10% of prize pool 

Ex: 100 people first week. Each bought 2 ape package. So 200 ape in total. 50% of pool so 100 goes to the dao. 100 ape left. 70 ape to first place. 20 ape to second place. 10 ape to third place. 

Every week a new winner is chosen and scores are reset 

Building out a simple mini game like this with cheap transactions allows for an additional revenue source for the DAO in addition to allowing players a chance at weekly ape prizes.

Disclaimer:
Proxlab is completing some research around this specifically trying to get a couple of the technical questions answered. There may be slight adjustments to start time, vision, and time to develop. Price paid to proxlab will remain the same and not change however.",0x42f3be9717d96e42cd7ab731fb74a69280f8bb83,2022-12-01T15:17:47.000Z,0x3772c7af3367b93e23b9634d2d7019bf8d9827c2329ff35dce14bf27f7309dbb,2022-12-04T15:16:59.000Z,ACTIVE,8,"{""For"":""["",""Against"":""3"",""Abstain"":""5""}",https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0x3772c7af3367b93e23b9634d2d7019bf8d9827c2329ff35dce14bf27f7309dbb,https://deepdao.io/user/0x42f3be9717d96e42cd7ab731fb74a69280f8bb83/verified_dao_experience

51,44c6b623-b204-4fd3-acea-1960092853a4,SNAPSHOT,CLever Booster Program (Tranche 2),"# Background: 
As we announced in our [*CLever Booster program*](https://medium.com/@0xC_Lever/lets-be-clever-together-bd6300218ee5), 4% of the total CLEV tokens will be distributed to members of the community who have supported CLever through content creation, education, and engagement. We will distribute the tokens on a monthly basis based on community vote of veCLEV token holders. xALD token holders will eventually direct Aladdin's treasure share of veCLEV; however, for the first two monthly votes, will abstain since the shares were pre-vested.


Every booster is an excellent and valuable contributor. We have tried to capture some of the most representative and ""best of"" content in a [supplemental *spreadsheet*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eGHGqn2S8GT0E3eY6RWDQTM6Ynr1mB6yVK6NRgD9X3k/edit#gid=996240196). You may split your voting power between as many nominees as you like. Remember that helping to reward the best CLever boosters will create a flywheel effect as the best content will bring more users which will increase the value of CLever. 

Ultimately, it's great for boosters, veCLEV holders, and the protocol.

# GGWP-1: DAO bootstrapping

Since the launch of the Gyroscope testnet early this year, thousands of users contributed to testing and joined the community. This proposal presents a vision for the next steps of maturing the community. It contains three parts:

- Ratify the current Gyro core development team, as FTL Labs, and give them a mandate to develop Gyro V1
- Ratify the high-level governance token distribution
- Inaugurate the initial Gyro multisig

## 1. Ratify the current Gyro core development team, as FTL Labs, and give them a mandate to develop Gyro V1

The first iteration of the Gyro system has been developed by a team of academic researchers and developers. The results of this research were made available at gyro.finance, and after very positive feedback from the community we are currently forming a software development company, FTL Labs, to formalise the relationship between Gyro, as an independent stablecoin and DAO, and the development team.

We ask the community to endorse FTL Labs as the Gyroscope core development team and present them with the mandate to complete the Gyroscope protocol v1.

## 2. Ratify the high-level governance token distribution

We propose that the Gyro DAO adopt a governance token, to be deployed soon by the core development team, based on the code available in the [Gyroscope GitHub repository](https://github.com/gyrostable/gyro-token).

We further propose that the Gyro governance token has the following initial distribution properties:

- 65% be vested to the community
- 35% be granted to the core development team (FTL Labs) to be used in furthering the development of the protocol. All tokens that come out of the Core Development allocation will be subject to lock-up schedules that follow industry standards.
- 2% inflation per year after 4 years, unlocking to the community treasury

*Subject to community approval, a more detailed release schedule will be released later. Some further detail on the token distribution is also available in the [Gyroscope forum](https://gov.gyro.finance/t/final-proposal-on-ggwp-1-bootstrapping-the-dao-and-giving-ftl-labs-a-mandate-to-build-gyro-v1/32).*

The proposed breakdown is more heavily weighted to the community than most major successful DeFi projects. This is motivated by the critical importance of decentralization for a stablecoin‚Äôs legitimacy. Further information is available on the Gyroscope blog.

## 3. Inaugurate the initial Gyro multisig

The initial DAO structure should be nimble and accommodate a voting structure that evolves as the community develops. We propose that the initial DAO adopts a 3/5 multisig to represent the community. All of the signers have been providing valuable input to Gyroscope:


- [Tarun Chitra](https://twitter.com/tarunchitra)
- [Mathijs van Esch](https://twitter.com/MathijsvEsch)
- [Hart Lambur](https://twitter.com/hal2001)
- [Fernando Martinelli](https://twitter.com/fcmartinelli)
- Geometry ([Tom Walton-Pocock](https://twitter.com/tomwaltonpocock))

For further information on the multisig signers‚Äô involvement with Gyroscope, see the full proposal in the [Gyroscope Forum](https://gov.gyro.finance/t/final-proposal-on-ggwp-1-bootstrapping-the-dao-and-giving-ftl-labs-a-mandate-to-build-gyro-v1/32).

The multisig is intended to take advice from the DAO community via an evolving voting mechanism (starting with the ‚Äúspace frog‚Äù NFTs). This community voting mechanism is intended to evolve throughout a transition period. Following this transition period, the multisig is intended to gradually relinquish control to the full Gyro DAO as it evolves the institutional checks and balances required for sound on-chain governance.

The tokens will be stored in the multisig for the interim period. The token contract is upgradeable, and the multisig will hold upgrade control for the interim period.",0x47a8a93ccee51fbb9608a7d74c09af1bd557a91d,2022-08-02T10:48:53.000Z,0xd28eba9a3493bc1c8c891a0ef7bd067fdc2d44277dbaf63eb761b2852282f648,2022-12-30T04:00:00.000Z,ACTIVE,7,"{""I have read the GGWP-1 proposal."":""["",""Join the GGWP-1 signatories."":""7""}",https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0xd28eba9a3493bc1c8c891a0ef7bd067fdc2d44277dbaf63eb761b2852282f648,https://deepdao.io/user/0x47a8a93ccee51fbb9608a7d74c09af1bd557a91d/verified_dao_experience

While taking profits (pools, liquidity, farming, staking, incentive or other tokens), this idea is to have something to look forward to live and to give. Live for youself. Give to others.

An example of this could be at the end of some profit cycle (stake, harvest), put 50% aside to re-invest and the other 50% for taxes, living and giving. While not financial advice and understanding taxes vary all over the world, putting half of the profit aside for taxes, may still leave some amount to live and give. Hopefully this amount leftover is 10% and can be divided as 5% for living, and 5% for giving.

Live 5% for you and your loved ones.

Give 5% to someone who needs help, whether an individual, or an organization that helps people.

""Live 5! Give 5!"" is a reminder to take profits, re-invest, to live, to give, to pay the taxes. With a little living and giving, we can improve our lives and other people's lives. When you give, give with love. With LOVE, With L-O-V-E. With L.O.V.E.

75,6ac34383-8f1d-416e-aad0-68d4c120ec37,SNAPSHOT,Please research the linear vesting strategy (like Mars Ecosystem). The price of SWIFT is still dropping too fast.,"If you implement a linear vesting strategy similar to Mars Ecosystem token (XMS) the price of SWIFT will be sustainable and not lose more than 50% of its value every week. I think a 30 day linear vesting strategy would go a long way to protect the lifespan of the SWIFT token. For example, each day the user can claim only 1/30th of their total balance of SWIFT tokens instead of being able to sell them all at once, which is the leading cause of the price dumping issue. This strategy will attract more serious investors, leading to a higher TVL, and there will not be a need for the APR resets.

_Tldr: The DXD Token Working Group proposes a new token model, where ‚ÄúDXD gets its value from DXdao‚Äôs treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.‚Äù_ This was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/proposal-to-upgrade-the-dxd-token-model/4719/12) and [submitted to DXdao here](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xb7ff31ec2bcdb8a254b8a1b06c6d2080a4089135b03ed55e684fd41b5176d946).

## Background

The DXD Bonding Curve was [launched in May of 2020](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xeb9cf2b3d76664dc1e983137f33b2400ad11966b1d79399d7ca55c25ad6283fa) by DXdao. The bonding curve was an effective fundraising tool but the mint/burn functions of the contract were never able to create a liquid market for DXD. In May 2021, DXdao [launched the DXD Buyback program](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) which purchased DXD off the open market using ETH from the general treasury as well as from the buyback reserve. The program [bought over 15,000 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit#gid=1629643942) (30% of circulating supply), but it was never viewed as a sustainable long-term model for DXD value accrual.

Since the bonding curve launched, DXdao has built and managed several DeFi and governance products, diversified its treasury into $10m+ of stablecoins, and has a team of 20+ full-time contributors focused on building and growing the DXdao ecosystem. The DXD token is at the center of this ecosystem, but there has not been a formal link between the value that DXdao creates and the DXD token. This creates uncertainty for DXD holders, especially as DXD has traded at a significant discount to book value.

In August 2022, DXdao [launched the DXD Token Working Group](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) to draft a long-term model for DXD. The below signal proposal is an output from the Working Group.

The proposal commits DXdao to:



* Introduce four tools in the DXD Monetary Policy Framework that would enable a fair and liquid market for DXD
* Establish a DXD Monetary Policy Committee
* Funding product development and other initiatives that further DXdao‚Äôs core mission to enable community freedom 

To further simplify and answer the question, ‚ÄúWhy is DXD valuable?‚Äù, the WG affirms: **DXD gets its value from DXdao‚Äôs treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.**

## Details

**DXD Monetary Policy Framework**
This proposal establishes four tools to be used by DXdao governance under guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. These are:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee - DXdao commits to buying any amount of DXD on the open market 
* Inverse bonds - smart contracts where DXD can be deposited for a defined period of time in return for a certain % of DXdao treasury assets 
* New DXD minted - allow DXD to be minted in exchange for assets at full NAV
* Protocol-owned liquidity for DXD

**DXD Monetary Policy Committee**
Management of these tools requires close tracking of the DXD market as well as DXdao‚Äôs treasury. The committee should be at least three individuals and also include full-time contributors. This work should be compensated in vested DXD. The committee is tasked with:



* Providing quarterly reports on general general direction and outlook of DXD
* Issue monthly recommendations on inverse bond issuance and protocol-owned liquidity
* Work with DXdao governance and treasury on managing redemptions

**Product development funding**
DXdao‚Äôs mission is to enable community freedom. It was launched in 2019 as a radical experiment in decentralization. The DXD fundraiser was intended to raise funds for product development in line with this vision. The new token model represents a new social contract between REP & DXD holders. The DXD Token WG affirms DXdao‚Äôs commitment to building and funding decentralized products that enable community freedom by committing at least 6% of DXdao‚Äôs treasury to fund DXdao‚Äôs product & operations for a year.

This % can be changed at any time by governance and represents an overall budget suggestion for DXdao and is not a mandate to spend that amount, nor a maximum amount . This incentivizes the community to grow the size of the treasury.

## Implementation

This signal proposal is the output of the DXD Token Working Group, and if passed by REP & DXD holders, should be implemented by DXdao. Some of the elements will require significant development work before they can be put into practice. In the DXD Monetary Policy Framework, the DXD Floor Price Guarantee and the protocol-owned liquidity can be implemented using DXdao‚Äôs existing governance tools. 

This proposal commits to implement:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee priced at 70% of the current DXD-NAV Ratio (DXD's circulating market cap to Treasury NAV)
* Provide $250k in DXD/ETH on mainnet once DXD price hits 60% of Treasury NAV, another $250k deposit at 65%, and a $500k deposit when it hits 70% of NAV
* When ready, DXdao governance commits to issuing:
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 85% payout after 6 months will be issued, along with 
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 90% of NAV payout after one year, and
     - $1m in DXD Inverse bonds with 100% NAV payout after two years
* The current DXD token contract should be upgraded and the funds returned to the general treasury

## Definition and clarifications



* Treasury NAV - ultimately defined by governance through guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. This proposal affirms treasury NAV includes all stablecoins, ETH (including staked ETH and other derivatives), Swapr LPs or other liquidity provisioning instruments. It incorporates the value of other treasury assets (like SWPR, ENS, etc) with a pre-defined liquidity discount. The DXD-NAV ratio is the DXD circulating market cap (as defined in the last DXD buyback proposal) divided by the Treasury NAV. This will be calculated at least bi-weekly. The [latest version can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mS1sVmyP0Z3YiA1JiZpHgPHjSIh3da7MawpjQodE34Y/edit#gid=0).
* Inverse bonds - these will be individually launched according to specific parameters (duration, dividend stream, etc). The bonds should payout the % of NAV when they are due, not the NAV when the bond is issued or the DXD deposited. Bonds will need to have a redemption currency of either ETH or Dai/USDC.
* DXD Monetary Policy Committee is meant to involve engaged DXD holders in the formation of policy, but report preparation will need to be completed by DXdao contributors. Details of this will be further provided in the upcoming budget presentations by DXdao governance.
* DXdao may implement other tools to the DXD Monetary Policy Framework in addition to the four listed above. The goal is to incentivize an organic fair market for DXD with minimal open market operations and minimal changes to the underlying liquidity for the treasury.
* Execution of the price floor guarantee will occur on-chain through various trustless models. Previous DXD purchases were in smaller amounts, so executing on a larger scale will require more coordination.
