1,8cd93fc0-998c-4564-b183-966a9be5d1a1,SNAPSHOT,AIP 72: Rebalance ETH Pool,"**PLEASE NOTE: This is a special off-cycle vote which will run indefinitely, but we will snapshot the results in 48 hours (20 Sept 2022 @ 4pm UTC) - this is done so that no points will be emitted by this vote**

Do you agree with AIP 72: ‚ÄúRebalance ETH Pool‚Äù should be implemented?

- This AIP is proposed as a one-time process which will emit no points for voting

- AirSwap claims are currently unavailable due to a Activate RPC node issue

- Token pool distributions are unequally distributed as a result

- The unequal distribution will result in a large disparity in claims between early and late claimants. Previously referred to as the ""fastest finger first"" issue with claiming rewards.

- This AIP proposes to split fees equally among 9 tokens before resuming claims to reduce the disparity between claimants.

**CoinLyse** is a new generation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) software that can predict the next price based on multiple conditions, such as how the chart reacts to the current price over the life of the crypto coin, and makes a lot of comparisons based on all the times he reached the current price, also, builds its analysis on a lot of other conditions such as the strength of buyers and sellers and more...

But the most important thing about **CoinLyse** is that its AI software upgrades its algorithm every day to get better prediction.

And other important feature that we have our program can also predict the average price that can be reached (Currently you can see the expected price for the next 1 hour, 1 day and 7 days)

what are you waiting for? Watch our simple video tutorial and start trying it out with a small budget or on the TradingView Whitepaper and after you find the best strategy you can use on your real money to make more money!

And I want to point out that we will soon provide an API if you are interested in creating your own BOT and we are also planning to publish our private BOT and our other tools

NOTE: We have started our project with BNB to analyze AI results after that we will upgrade it to support more coins

23,da9956dc-8a87-40c0-a066-b8991d67e574,SNAPSHOT,Tokenomic Issues,"I propose to increase the APR of staking and liquidity providing to reward the active users of Pancakeswap.

With low APRs (and getting lower due to votes) we are not incentivising people to use Pancakeswap directly, if CAKE has little to no emmisions at all why use Pancakeswap? Just hold your CAKE in an exchange, much easier.

I don't think people fully understand the effect of emissions, think of emissions as a company giving stock dividends instead of cash, let's say 4% stock dividend, nothing happens at all, because everybody gets 4% (This is not the case for Pancakeswap since we have burns).

However not all CAKE holders get the best returns. Let's go back to the dividend example, some people get the 4%, some don't, in this scenario the 4% return guy actually gets something because he gets more compared to others. This is a good way to reward people who actually use Pancakeswap.

If CAKE emmisions go to zero, there will be no more staking and rewards for providing liquidity is very low. What do you think will happen to Pancakeswap if that occurs?

Here's another one, people just get excited over high APRs even if it's pure inflation. (to reiterate CAKE is not purely inflationary due to burns).

From what I see most people want CAKE to be deflationary, which is great, but not the best option. If what you want is to get the maximum amount of value, increasing emissions is the best option. If you're reading this you're one of the people going to benefit from higher emissions. 

I'm not proposing to increase the emissions to max immediately, there are people who want the exact opposite of what I'm proposing after all. 

Deflation can still be achieved, what we need to do is focus on deflationary products, instead of trying to force it through lower emissions.

We get more burns if more people use the platform, increasing emissions will get us more users.

Thank you for reading, let's continue to make this a great community.",0x2f4879b1e962df56a82a8758a58344fa706d8943,2022-01-29T06:58:18.000Z,QmSRVzxoqhzTDExpv3KRYuTZZ5TZWPdNjazkXZHLVLv8Cs,2022-12-31T16:00:00.000Z,ACTIVE,262,"{""Make the emissions rise slowly."":""["",""Continue what we're doing before."":""2"",""Make the emissions rise slowly and prioritize products with burn mechanisms."":""7""}",https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/QmSRVzxoqhzTDExpv3KRYuTZZ5TZWPdNjazkXZHLVLv8Cs,https://deepdao.io/user/0x2f4879b1e962df56a82a8758a58344fa706d8943/verified_dao_experience

95,05bd21cb-89c2-42be-b296-e281b8ed3ed9,SNAPSHOT,[GIP-11] GoodDollar V3 - Protocol Enhancements,"This vote refers to a range of updates to the GoodDollar protocol, summarized as GoodDollar V3.

All proposed changes are in seek of GoodDollar protocol‚Äôs ultimate goal, which is to issue a sustainable crypto universal basic income protocol that enables people to use G$ as a medium of exchange.

All proposed changes are designed to:

- encourage usage and engagement among active G$ holders and community members
- reduce the rate of leverage of the currency, to encourage sustainable growth with minimal price volatility
- Lay the groundwork for the GoodDollar protocol to begin to fund community-led initiatives
- Allocate 20% of the daily G$ UBI mint towards savings rewards and a community fund: savings rewards (10% of daily UBI mint) and a GoodDAO community fund (10%).
- These changes will impact the rate of GoodDollar minting. The number of GoodDollars minted and distributed daily will decrease; the daily G$ claim amount per user will also decrease; however, these modifications are in service of creating a more sustainable economic policy for GoodDollar for its long-term future
- These proposed changes will be developed, activated, and implemented over the period of November 2022 through Q1 2023, as per the larger V3 roadmap 13.
The proposed code and protocol upgrades as part of this GIP will be voted on Snapshot and executed by the GoodDollar Guardians, per GIP 2 . 2

Proposed Protocol Changes

1. Eliminate Staking APY Rewards for Mainnet Stakers

-The current staking rewards rate:
      Compound: 36.03%
       Aave: 40.71%
- The original goal of the Staking Rewards was to encourage every day people to be able to use their crypto to fund for good, and source a sustainable source of staked capital.
        - Since V2, only 17 individual wallets have staked. The primary staker has 
 been eToro, a corporate donor that has already donated their earned interest rates.
- Amount distributed as G$ rewards vs. value of UBI generated.
   Current staked:
    $1,207,488.11 (16 stakers)
- Rewards paid:
     G$ 438,388,608.00
     $76,235.06 ( G$ price = 0.000173)
      Distributed out to all active stakers. eToro‚Äôs $1 million stake is not considered for the rewards 
      calculation.
- UBI minted from yield:
   G$ 100,413,879.40
   $ 17,461.81 ( G$ price = 0.000173)

- The original goal of the staking rewards have not yielded the intended effect of attracting a large volume of staked capital to fund sustainable UBI.
- Rather than continue to allocate GoodDollar rewards as a staking APY, we propose to mint and allocate GoodDollar rewards to community members who save in G$, and fortify the ecosystem. See ‚ÄúG$ Savings‚Äù below.
- G$ Stakers will receive entitled rewards upon withdrawal of their funds from the current staking contract.
- Staking contracts will no longer deliver an APY in G$, but market rate earned interest can still be used to deposit funds into the GoodReserve.
- Stakers will continue to earn GOOD tokens for their stake. This is part of a longer term plan to attract corporate stakers and partners through providing a way to meaningfully engage and influence with the economy.
- GOOD allocations to stakers are subject to further changes.

2. Reduce Speed of Minting - Reduce Reserves Ratio from 20% ‚Üí 15%

- This change is proposed to ensure GoodDollars are being minted at a healthy and sustainable rate, and the currency is not being leveraged too quickly relative to the circulating supply, and value in the GoodReserve.
- The current reserve ratio is 69%.
- The Reserve Ratio is currently set to reduce by 20% per year.
- The proposed change will slow down the rate of minting. The proposed change is to reduce the reserve ratio to 15% reduction per year.
This reduces the rate of leverage, of G$ minted relative to cDAI in the GoodReserve.

3. G$ Savings

- This proposed change suggests allocating G$ rewards for community members that stake their G$. This will enable members who stake and save their G$ to earn G$ bonuses alongside GOOD tokens.
- Currently, staking G$ is rewarded with GOOD tokens, the non-transferable governance token of the GoodDollar ecosystem.
- A G$ savings rate also creates an additional incentive for community members to hold G$, in order to save. G$ stakers will continue to earn GOOD tokens for their stake, as well.
- The proposal would be to allocate a modest portion (10%) of the daily GoodDollars G$ minted as UBI, and allocate those G$ to be used towards a reward savings pool to fund G$ stakers.
- GoodDollar savers will be rewarded a fixed 5% APY from the rewards pool, on annual basis.
- The savings rewards smart contract will be activated for users and launched by January 2023.

Update 31/07/2022Code that passed initial audit: https://github.com/GoodDollar/GoodProtocol/pull/259 4

4. G$ DAO Community Fund

Currently all G$ minted are distributed as UBI to active members of the ecosystem. This proposal suggests allocating a portion of the G$ minted for daily UBI, to be moved into a community fund that is managed by the GoodDAO.

- This proposal suggests allocating a percentage of G$ minted daily towards a community fund that will be managed and overseen by a set of community guardians, nominated by GoodDAO.
- The proposal is to allocate 10% of the daily GoodDollars G$ minted as UBI and allocate those to a community fund controlled by a yet to be created GoodDollar DAO funds committee.
- These funds will be automatically diverted into a smart contract that will be transferred to a multisig upon selection of the GoodDollar DAO funds committee. Upon ratification of this vote, an additional proposal will be enacted to create a group of 5 community guardians to sit on the multisig.
- The intended purpose of the GoodDollar DAO funds is to encourage community-driven GoodDollar adoption and its usage as a medium of exchange.
   Examples of intended usage of the G$ funds:
    -GoodDAO Grants DAO: enable a community fund to vote on and fund G$ entrepreneurs and community members.
    -GoodDAO Jobs: enable the GoodDAO to propose key working groups, roles, work to be done, local chapters and initiatives and have a source of funds to fund it.
    -Fund the creation of GoodDAO working groups, such as protocol research, local marketing teams, and more.
    -GoodDAO treasury: over the 5-10 year time period, these funds could be used for the GoodDollar protocol to begin to fund operating costs currently subsidized by the GoodDollar LLC, such as gas fees, hosting, etc.


Motivation for asking changes in such Protocol policy

- Reduce leverage in the GoodDollar ecosystem
- Prepare for incoming funds to the Reserve
- Reward active community members who are transacting in G$
- Empower the GoodDAO with a community fund to promote its own adoption
- All changes are subject to further changes
    -The protocol vision is to build out a multi-asset Reserve, as well as multi-chain Staking protocols

98,2bdcfc6f-cd86-47b2-aa2e-e33720ce9369,SNAPSHOT,OIP-0 How To Use Snapshot & Create Proposals,"Hey Octonauts,

If we reach that stage of OctoFi and you are reading this, then we are already doing great.
Openness and transparency are central to OctoFi‚Äôs mission in the delivery of decentralized finance (oracles) tentacles. 
The primary use-case afforded by project supporters will be the foundational governance decisions. During early stages, OCTO governance tokens shall be used for the following:
- Participating in voting to settle governance decisions 
- Verifying data tentacles and support systems with staking
- Interest Program (Octo Yield)

How to use Snapshot as proposal creator:
1. Go to https://dao.octo.fi
2. Click on the button in the right corner ‚ÄúConnect wallet‚Äù
3. Connect with one of the three wallet providers, where you hold $OCTO
4. Click on the button ‚ÄúNew proposal‚Äù at the main page https://snapshot.page/#/octofi
5. Fill out the field Title:
OIP-[consecutive number] Title of your Proposal
6. Fill out the biggest field and tell the community about your idea or question, go into every detail. Don't forget plans about how to execute the idea or question, and funding, if needed.
7. Place the voting options 
8. Now go to the ‚ÄúActions‚Äù box 
9. Select the start date 
10. Select the end date (Remember to give enough time for voting)
11. Fill out the Snapshot block number (now it's getting a bit crazy, read more about that number in the next section)

Snapshot block number:
This number is important to lock the state of community members who are able to vote.
Means if you come around a nice proposal and the block number is in the past and you don't own any $OCTO yet or before the block number, you can't vote.

H = h + ((t1 ‚Äî t0) / a) 

Where:
H = target block height
h = current block height
t0 = current timestamp (in seconds)
t1 = target timestamp (in seconds)
a = average time to solve a block (in seconds)
Easy right ?
Or 
last_block_number + ((future_time - time_now) / block_time)

So, for example, using a current epoch time (https://www.epochconverter.com) of 1481214124, the epoch time of 1482537600 for midnight Christmas Eve, and the last block of 2771338:
2771338 + ((1482537600 - 1481214124) / 14) = 2865872

Or just look at https://etherscan.io/blocks and use the last block number ;-)

12. Click on ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù and create the proposal 
13. Sign the message via your wallet and done

How to use Snapshot for voting ?
1. Go to https://dao.octo.fi
2. Click on the button in the right corner ‚ÄúConnect wallet‚Äù
3. Connect with one of the three wallet provider, where you hold $OCTO
4. Click on the option you want to vote for 
5. Sign the message via your wallet and done

To test your voting capabilities, let's start with a simple question.

Who was Satoshi Nakamoto?
