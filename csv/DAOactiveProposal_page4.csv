1,da9956dc-8a87-40c0-a066-b8991d67e574,SNAPSHOT,PancakeSwap USD ,"Make a stablecoin backed by CAKE, called PUSD (PancakeSwap USD).

PUSD's market cap will be controlled for CAKE and PancakeSwap's safety and future.

PUSD's marketcap will not be allowed to surpass 10% of CAKE's marketcap.

PUSD will only be sold on PancakeSwap.

To control PUSD's marketcap, once it's past the 10% limit, PUSD will be more expensive than a dollar. If PUSD gets bought for more than a dollar the added price will be used to buy CAKE then burned. One PUSD will keep getting more expensive relative to the dollar as the percent of PUSD's market cap goes up further to the 10% limit.

One PUSD is exchangeable for 1 dollar worth of cake and vice versa in normal circumstances, but if PUSD's market cap goes up the 10% limit, exchanging 1 CAKE (let's say 1 CAKE is 10$) for PUSD will not give 10 PUSD because it's up the limit. However 10 PUSD can be exchanged for more than one CAKE, if the price is above a dollar, this will still have the fee.

Selling PUSD for CAKE will have a 1% fee, but buying PUSD does not. Fee will be used to burn CAKE.

PUSD can be staked to earn cake. With low interest rates, lower than what you would get to stake CAKE to earn CAKE.

PUSD staking will also have lock times. similar to CAKE staking, this will have afterburner and multipliers effects.

PUSD is not the best stablecoin, but it's safe, 100% backed, sustainable, and will not cause a crisis like Terra has.

2,60c9b31c-4495-4028-aeac-eb7bb117fece,SNAPSHOT,Instaverse – build your metaverse presence instantly,"> by 0x538ce85ccf6080cec960bc5341787691217c4d97 (Johnny#4d97)

Should the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

To build a presence/scene for brand in Decentraland requires experience and is accessible mostly for skilled people so far.

In DAPPCRAFT we realized that we can lower the entry barrier into Decentraland for everyone without platform/builder experience.

This is how Instaverse was born - an easy way for everyone to bring an Instagram profile into Metaverse as an auto generated scene with a few clicks. The scene is pre-customized to profile look and feel and then deployed into Decentraland.
Instaverse is a great tool for anyone who wants to create a Decentraland presence, regardless of their skill level. With Instaverse, anyone can easily create and access their own Decentraland world.

## Description

### This project is going to solve:

*   easy entry for influencers and bloggers to share metaverse space with friends
*   give landowners ability to lend their land
*   lower barrier entry to business into Decentraland

InstaVerse is a platform for anyone to create amazing scene in Decentraland based on Instagram profile in 3 easy steps:

![3 easy steps](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/steps.png)
This means that there is a larger pool of people who are able to create amazing scenes and share them with friends to hang out together.

### How Instaverse is going to be self sustainable?

We are going to use the subscription model for users and charge a monthly fee for a “private residence” scene in Decentraland or place in Instaverse Tower. This will allow keeping their ""spaces"" online, similar to hosting websites in classic web20 hosting business.
As we have a verbal agreement with the number of landowners, we are going to start with free of charge model to attract more users.

### Instaverse Tower

It is a new skyscraper scene in Decentraland that will offer an affordable space for everyone at a lower price. This is a great entry point for creators/businesses to opportunity to get involved in the Metaverse. Creators can use this space to reach a wider audience.
In future plans, we have a vision to have multiple towers as a scalable solution.

### For Landowners

Landowners can make money by leasing out their land to Instaverse and use a subscription-based system. In this system, users pay a subscription fee that allows them to use the land to host a scene. The landowner makes money from the subscriptions that are paid each month.

### Long term vision

In the future, we will expand our services to work with other social networks like Facebook (Facebook pages), LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, ArtStation, Behance, and websites to create a rich and easy-to-use experience for metaverse integration.


## Specification

### Private Residence

A 1x1 private space generated based on Instagram profile.

![proccess-1](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/scene-proccess.jpg)
![proccess-2](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/scene-proccess2.jpg)

**Space customization includes:**

*   Pictures gallery from Instagram feed
*   The Stable Diffusion AI models will generate unique textures based on the profile data. This will give a personalized look and feel for a scene
*   Instagram highlights

### USERNAME AND PICTURE

![custom-1](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/preview-1.jpg)

### PHOTO FEED AND HIGHLIGHTS

![custom-2](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/preview-2.jpg)

### DIFFERENT COLOR SCHEMES WITH AI-GENERATED TEXTURES

![custom-3](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/preview-3.jpg)

### Instaverse Tower

Each Instaverse Tower will have 4x4 size and 15 floors. This will allow providing services for about 150 owners per one spot. This will save on renting/buying land, construction costs and get beautifully designed space. In the future, it opens a variety of others gamified in exciting ways that would include all participants and their guests.

### System architecture

![System architecture](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/system-flow.jpg)

### We are going to build architecture with the following modules:

1.  **Parser** - Instagram profile scraper. We need to make sure we respect the platform restrictions.
2.  **Color picker.** This module will figure out the main 3 colors in Instagram profile based on avatar, highlights, feed.
3.  **AI texture generator.** Based on the main color from Instagram profile, we use Stable Diffusion which is open source and specially trained model to generate textures. Example.
4.  **Scene assembler.** The user data (links and pictures) is applied to a 3D scene.
5.  **Deployment module.** We are going to create automating deployment scripts. At DAPPCRAFT we already have DevOps scripts in place. We're going to reuse them and adapt in this project.

## Description

**Decentraland <> Polkadot**\
Recently I've been building an educational platform to teach dcl users about the polkadot ecosystem:\
https://play.decentraland.org/?position=95%2C122\&realm=dg\&island=I14iy1 \
(https://BUITL.COM) \
(This platform can be used for other things but let me explain why polkadot is a great partnership)\
\
There are over 30 parachains on polkadot. Each with their own tools, dapps, communities, founders, developers and financial ecosystems. A lot of these projects are building stuff that can be integrated into decentraland.\
\
Later this month I will be doing an event to showcase https://talisman.xyz
(A non-profit metamask alternative that can already be used to log in to decentraland and access polkadot and ethereum data at the same time.. *-Drops mic-* )\
https://twitter.com/coinatomy/status/1594690826617200642/
\
\
**How this benefits Decentraland?**\
Over the next couple of months I will be hosting events for individual parachains. DCL will receive more attention from the polkadot community resulting in more active users through organic marketing and more tools being built for decentraland. Polkadot has around 15,000 active developers and I plan to reach out to as many as possible, to see if they are interested in contributing..
I've been involved in polkadot since 2016 and developed good relationships with a lot of polkadot/kusama brands. But with a new ecosystem being added every other week it is becoming hard to keep up with all the developer activity. So I want to bring them all together and show them why decentraland is the best metaverse on the market.\
\
**So what have we BUITL so far?**\
UNO (Which I will opensource)\
A Quiz system for inputting/approving/viewing questions..\
Maze (Ready for some paintball?)


## Specification

**What we want to build next?**\
**1.** So we want to allow cross chain transactions in-game from polkadot. This is considerably harder than polygon because most of polkadot is not EVM compatible. So our plan is to build a substrate pallet that can be added to an existing parachain like a piece of lego. Then we can work with the talisman code to build a kinda dot-connect (similar to the widely popular eth-connect) which should allow polkadot transactions in-game.\
**2.** The quiz we've **BUITL** is a really good tool for education. I would like to get all of the dot communities to submit good questions and answers about their projects so that we can expand the consciousness of education. Things we would like to include are; NFTs, games, competitions, leaderboards and more. Sure, we're open to suggestions.\
**3.** Paintball\
**4.** Once the above is completed we want to start working on a polkadot L2 in-game marketplace!


## Personnel

**Who?**\
*Butter#4840* - Been promoting DCL since launch. Doing events on my own since May 2020. With the most notable being Keep Networks hackathon in Sept 2020 which received 2.2m views from 50,000 unique addresses.. Since then I've been doing smaller events for individual companies and projects.\
*Binh* - WSS/Backend stuff. Can build anything.\
*Max* - Graphic designer recently aquired. \\


## Roadmap and milestones

**Budget?**\
Currently I've spent about $25k on the quiz and UNO.\
And it will take about $30k to build a substrate pallet and dot-connect.\
\
**Why proposal?**\
As you can see we're hitting new development milestones every day. Up until now I have been paying for everything myself. Cross-chain transactions is something that everyone will benefit from and it doesn't make sense to have to pay for everything myself.\
\
**So let's get it BUITL!**\

- Flour: one cup of all-purpose flour (foundation of pancakes) .
- Baking powder: two teaspoons (the secret to fluffiness).
- Sugar: two tablespoon
- Salt: just a pinch (1/3 of a teaspoon), it will enhance the overall flavor 
- Milk: one cup
- Butter: melted, two tablespoons (adds moisture and richness to the pancakes).
- Egg: a whole egg (helps to bind everything together).

Sift flour and sugar (dry ingridients) into a bowl. Make a well in the centre.
Add milk, egg and melted butter (wet ingridients), whisk to combine.
Heat a large non stick frying pan over medium heat and grease lightly with butter or oil.
For each pancake, place 2 tablespoons of batter into the pan. Cook for 2 minutes or until bubbles form on the surface. Turn and cook for a further 1 to 2 minutes, or until pancakes are cooked through.
 
Garnish with berries, sliced banana or any toppings, such as butter, maple syrup, confectioners' sugar, honey, jams, preserves, sweetened whipped cream, or chocolate syrup.",0x6e3246041a89d2e70609ce6f4ac0db785bd8768c,2022-10-24T14:21:56.000Z,0x5eda2621ccf4d85ec4369e8351d6c5f9bc885bbdf42ec82fd16999fd6e47da88,2022-12-24T21:00:00.000Z,ACTIVE,60,"{""Yes"":""["",""No, we don't need this"":""1""}",https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0x5eda2621ccf4d85ec4369e8351d6c5f9bc885bbdf42ec82fd16999fd6e47da88,https://deepdao.io/user/0x6e3246041a89d2e70609ce6f4ac0db785bd8768c/verified_dao_experience

Some builds are designed on NDA contracts.,

Together the team wants to bring a change on the platform in terms of building structures to make Decentraland full of functional active spots by its users. Users and landowners in decentraland will benefit directly from this proposal. We offer 75+ unique build designs that can be used by everyone in decentraland.


## Specification

Pros to Decentraland:

The owner of a parcel can start some activity without the hassle of building a structure.
This proposal will revitalize dead lands and increase engagement as it would be a hassle-free process to deploy scenes/ builds.
These builds can be used by several creators who are doing events and need a better build.
The builds will include 1x1, 2x1, 2x2 (Clubs with SDK), offices, headquarters, NFT Galleries, and 3x3 event spaces, and concert stage.
This will lead to more engagement on the platform since there will be multiple active scenes.

*Monetary Benefits to Decentraland:*

It will be up to the community to decide how to distribute the builds for this part, We can vote on the following options. We will conduct a separate poll to decide what the community wants.

Poll Option 1: To make these builds completely public and accessible to everyone.

Poll Option 2: Make the builds available as NFT collections so users can buy them for a nominal charge $20, $30 $40 & $50 from Opensea and all profits go to the DAO treasury address.

Job opportunity: There will be a need to add logos, place NFTs, and make minor/major changes to the build. We will be selecting individuals from within the community who are able to work on the 3D models so they can edit these builds for individuals and projects with Dhingia Builds and can earn an income.

Build Features:

Builds will have striking and distinctive designs.
Decentraland norms and specifications will be followed when building.
Builds will have various size options.
Builds will have the facility of light, interiors and elevators.
Builds can be customised using DCL builder.
Builds will be within triangle limits and SDK friendly.
Builds will have perfect collisions and layout for movement.

Builds are fully functional and can be customised by USER based on an individual's needs and project requirements. Comes with an instruction video “How to deploy the scene?”. We will provide a series of videos detailing how to place the build on land, install other GLB files, assets, and other general SDK features to make the build more functional. Also, the videos for editing the Game.ts and Scene.json files and setting up the build for deploying on the land parcel. A special discord and website will be developed for distributing these builds to the community

Apart from making these 75+ builds and assets, Dhingia Builds pledges to help 10 projects/Individuals with custom (upto 2 parcels) free builds who add value to Decentraland which We have done earlier too, so We wish to continue the same. It could be educational institutions, religious organizations, NGOs or individual creators in need of builds. Anyone can apply for the Custom Build with the idea and how it will bring value to Decentraland.


## Personnel

Mr. Dhingia Personal: I Joined DCL in Nov 2021, I'm a Decentraland builder. I own Dhingia Club (144,-148) and build 3D architecture for commercial and personal use in Decentraland and other metaverses. Through Dhingia club we've hosted many events including birthday parties, cultural events, and launch parties for builds. I publish wearables, and actively engage with the DCL DAO on a daily basis. I often gift builds to individuals who contribute to DCL's success. I also actively spread the word about metaverse and give out merch at IRL events like XVERSE, a Decentraland collaboration at Gitex Global, World Trade Center, Dubai, UAE and others.

## Roadmap and milestones

Additionally, 5 builds will be made available immediately by Mr. Dhingia for the community when the proposal is passed after the voting process.
Five builds will be released each month.
As these structures/builds are developed, they will be displayed in District X, Decentraland

If the platform supports builders, it will be highly appreciated. Builders and developers are essential to Decentraland.

We are open for any questions, kindly leave your feedback and suggestions.

Sincerely,

Mr Dhingia

## Abstract

NPACT (npact-village.com) focuses on community growth, research, and adaptation of Decentraland as our mission. With metaverses and gaming experiences evolving towards full Virtual Reality (VR)  we investigate potential effects of this transition. Virtual reality and sports will continue to grow recreationally, professionally, and medically, however biomedical research has yet to evaluate the impact of this new VR technology, as ethical and health concerns arise. This grant provides a scientific investigation of potential dangers and benefits of VR integration into the metaverse. Our expert teams of Medical Practitioners, Researchers and Decentraland community members seek to answer these questions.

## Description

We spend an increasing amount of our daily life in the digital environment. This is not a new thing, but the ability to meet social, work, educational, cultural, and even IRL maintenance without ever leaving your computer exploded in post-covid. With this explosion of work from home coupled with tradition gym closures and technologically leverage products like Peloton reaching mass adoption, the future partnership of exercise and the metaverse finally moved beyond its perpetually nascent phase.

To say it has reached full adoption, or is technically proficient as desired, would be taking great liberty with the truth. However, while the technology is lagging, the social structure of sports, includes its competitive nature, are taking subtle but significant steps. Beyond a traditional leader board displaying a name and temporary high score, individualized avatar athletes provide recognition, branding, and the under pinning of the tribal mentality associated with sports rivalries.

Digital uniforms and team names and identities which under tradition are regionally formed, with specialized equipment and sponsorship following, has been turned on its head. In contrast, factors including time zones, preferred equipment, technological compatibility and political affiliations are component parts of the whole. While not the focus of this project, these factors must be considered during any ethical design review process. As these factors could lead to over exertion and injury in any environment, we will endeavor to identify and isolate their direct impact on the metaverse based virtual gaming environment.

As discussed above, home exercise has moved leaps and bounds from aerobic types of yesteryear. Now, instead of being led by the recording, we are now recording the leader. However, that leader is not always human and classes give way for competition on a more regular basis. Without the unpredictability of inclement weather, cost of ravel, ongoing communication, and generally large time commitment associated with organized sporting events, more frequent and bespoke functions are possible.

Ranging from a group of friends virtually cycling together to an esports arena teaming with thousands, virtual reality and sports will continue to grow recreationally, professionally, and medically. Biomedical research and implementation while quite conspicuous with the Invictus games, the impact of tech many not be as obvious in character design and movement. For example, at one of the most simple designs, an underwater adventure game, while perfectly safe for the human behind the goggles, would spell destruction if replicated in the real world. While seemingly far-fetched and low-hanging fruit as an example, it speaks to a potentially increasing problem, realism in avatar function and design. Even the greatest suspension of reality would have difficulty reasonably finding a gamer trying to fly off a building as a dragon. But could the same be said for a human gamer trying to imitate a Tetris style climbing game in the real world if digitally designed? In light of the multiple injuries suffered each year in pursuit of social media challenges like the mild crate climb, these risks become increasingly foreseeable. Simply put, as the likeness to human increases in avatar, does the risk of injury though imitation on competition simply increase?


## Specification

### Research question

To what degree, if any, does an omnidirectional sporting device and combination with virtual reality increase the risk of injury to the participant?

### Sub Questions

1.  To what degree, if any, does the underlying physical condition of a participant contribute to risk?
2.  To what degree if any are risks associated with physical condition mitigated or warned against by manufactures?
3.  To what degree of commonality, if any, will new omnidirectional related injuries occur?
    What are the most likely injuries?
4.  To what degree, if any, does the environmental design of the game enhance risk of injury?
5.  To what degree, if any, does the design and functionality of the avatar enhance risk of injury?

### Hypothesis

It is our belief that game designers did not properly anticipate the incongruity of digital physical capabilities in design, resulting in participants mimicking unnatural actions or the avatar or game requirements resulting in new sports injuries patterns or occurrences.

### Design

Utilizing the Kat VR Omnidirectional system in conjunction with the Oculus Rift, our participants will engage in gaming and digital sports, captured on video. Following 10 sessions to allow familiarity and ease, our lead physician researcher will review the kinetics, identify the greatest points for risk of injury. This will be correlated with the gaming interaction for design review. Following processing and correlation of all data, the highest and most common risks will be identified for further study and to offer precautions to the community at large.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?

## Abstract

Problem

Beside DCL Report’s Arabic stream, there’s next to no Arabic content about DCL, neither in media where people can learn about DCL, nor educational content to guide new users through DCL’s ecosystem.

While Arabic is the 5th most spoken language on earth, and MENA residents account for 12.5% of all humans, there is no dedicated language or regional channel for Arabs on DCL’s Discord.

Solution

We will create and publish a package of educational content on DCL in Arabic, launch an Arabic channel on DCL’s Discord, and provide support to new joiners from the region.

Team

We produced 5 videos in Arabic about DCL & metaverse. Our team includes the first Arab DCL Reporter.

\*The proposal was revised in accordance with received feedback

50,219ab5ef-9345-448b-bbf2-786a33e4edd8,SNAPSHOT,CoreProp: Deduct Kinship on channelling (OG Kinship),"**Author:** yanik | yanik#0015
**GotchiID:** 4751
**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/kinship-og-kinship-economical-proposal/4524
**SigProp:** https://vote.aavegotchi.com/#/proposal/0x894039351d89063285281b2d941c7b5ffc2dcde5899b981785843fe7bc3eb37c 

### Problem 
Kinship is our protocol's only resource that is given almost for free. However, as our economy developed, it's clear we can't inflate it in such passes: other game components, like farming and crafting, can't cover the rising UBI inflation rate.

### Change 
Deduct 4 Kinship each time gotchi is channelling the altar. 

### Gameplay
Such a change provides aavegocthi an interesting choice on how to play the game:
(1) accumulate Kinship (+2 kinship /day) and improve the character farming specs
(2) farm alchemica once per 2 days without losing the multiplayer 
(3) everything in between 1 and 2

### Economics 
It is impossible to predict how players will behave economically since many external factors, including general market conditions, are in play. Yet, given base numbers (+2 kin per day, -4 kin for channelling), I assume this change will cut efficient UBI alchemica inflow by 50%. 

### Contract changes
Implementation requires careful thinking about contract access rights, but other than the change is insignificant, especially compared to what effect it will have.

54,3ca99a9e-c6cb-46d5-b2c5-9c837ba01667,SNAPSHOT,BSP-9: Fund the Development and Execution of The Coop ,"## Proposer
Brean and Co.

## Summary
Fund the Coop with 90,000 Beans for development, execution, and seeding of initial capital.

## Purpose
The Coop is an implementation of the Liquity Chicken Bonds on the Beanstalk ecosystem. Chicken Bonds are a novel derivative built on top of liquity that organically builds protocol owned liquidity. Due to the similarities of liquity and beanstalk (namely, protocol native organic yield), we think that beanstalk would be a suitable stablecoin protocol to build chicken bonds on.

Multiple roles will be needed to launch a MVP: 

#### (Essential) Smart Contract Development: 
Currently being developed by Brean and Co.. Coop plans to utilize the ROOT token in order to accelerate development. Current progress is here: https://github.com/Brean0/Beansprout-Coop 

Compensation: 0 Beans will be transferred upon completion.

#### (Essential) Front End Development: 
A web3 Frontend is needed in order to create, view, and interact with the coop bonds. This needs to be composable with both circulating and farmer balances, as well as beanstalk and root. Pipeline can be used to massively improve UX experience (for example, swapping USDC to BEAN, depositing into the silo, minting ROOT, and depositing into a coop bond, all in one transaction).

Compensation: 15,000 Beans will be transferred upon completion.

#### (Non-essential) UX Development:

A good UX design would help facilitate adoption of coop bonds. 

UX Development is labeled “Non-essential” as someone could do both frontend and UX design, as well as utilize available UIs from chicken bonds.

Note: “Nonessential” does not mean “not required”, but “not mandatory” for an MVP. Brean and Co will determine in a project timeline that development has progressed to a point where UX changes would delay the project significantly. 

Compensation: 10,000 Beans will be transferred upon completion.


#### (Non-Essential) NFT Artwork: 

The Coop bonds will implement on-chain dynamic svg NFTs. Current implementation design is here. https://github.com/Brean0/Beansprout-Coop/blob/main/image.png. While this is enough for an MVP, the coop is open for alternative designs. The design must be able to be generated on chain, without the need of a separate contract.

Note: “Non-Essential” does not mean “not required”, but “not mandatory” for an MVP. Brean and Co will determine in a project timeline that development has progressed to a point where UX changes would delay the project significantly. 

Compensation: 5,000 Beans will be transferred upon completion.

Upon deployment of the coop contracts, the remaining unspent beans will be given to the protocol to bootstrap (it will be allocated to the permanent pool, meaning the deposit is forfeited and the yield will permanently be given to bROOT holders). 

## Security
 - Chicken bond audits (Coinspect + Dedaub)
https://github.com/liquity/ChickenBond/tree/main/LUSDChickenBonds/audits
 - Beanstalk Farm plans to allocate an audit stream for the COOP. 

### Risks

- Chicken Bonds are a new and novel implementation, and (at least in beanstalk) has not been tested in the real world. The nature of open-source opens the door for exploits in bugs, flaws, and errors. 
- Coop plans to utilize an upgradeable proxy and a multisig with beanstalk and root community members to enact changes on the will of the token holders, as well as emergency changes. 

## Future work
- Pending chicken bonds could theoretically be used as collateral to borrow BEAN/ROOTs. 
- Analytics can be developed on both the Coop NFT and bROOT token. 
- bROOT/ROOT or bROOT/BEAN could be whitelisted in the silo for stalk rewards, omitting the need for a 3% fee on Chicken In to incentivize liquidity. 
- Discussion on align liquity and the coop. Examples include:
     - Participating in governance to push for a BEAN:LUSD pool. 
     - Allocating a portion of ROOTs in the permanent pool and swap for BEAN:LUSD LP
- Discussion on utilizing ROOTs in permanent pool beyond the native yield
    - Market making on paradox’s parimutuel bets.
    - Purchasing pods on the market.
    - (requires fungible stalk) exchanging stalk for bean, at times of excess demand, or exchanging beans for stalk at times of excess supply. 

## Effective 
Upon passage of this BSP, 90,000 Beans will be sent to the Coop address.

Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?

## Abstract

We are launching the first service for moving brand collections to DCL for digital fashion enthusiasts and contributors. Our service will simplify creating digital collections from physical ones and immediately transfer them to DCL. The entire procedure for one collection will take a maximum of one week (our goal is a few days) and will replenish the DCL market with a large quantity of fashionable and high-quality wearables at affordable prices.
Seamm is a mobile app that stores and transfers digital collections to metaverses and video games. The current stage of development includes the feature transfer to DCL. Our team requires resources to optimize the speed of digitizing brand collections and publishing them on the DCL marketplace.

60,000 USD

## Description

Brands desire to sell and market their garments and accessories in DCL, but frequently lack the knowledge and resources to do it quickly and effectively. Players in Decentraland desire to be able to purchase and wear trendy and cool wearables in DCL, however the marketplace's existing selection of wearables is characterized by sporadic, restricted releases from brands and generally prohibitive pricing. Our service will assist in bridging the gap between businesses and their audiences in order to enrich the material for the DCL marketplace and promote digital collections of brands with minimal effort.
Brands will obtain a new channel for the quick and professional distribution of their fashion collections, while the DCL community will have access to a diverse selection of high-quality content (wearables and accessories) at a reasonable price.


## Specification

We will construct more integration with the DCL API using the subsequent processes and combine it with the existing mobile application. To start we’ll work with three brands for
Processes:

*   Create a collection
*   Collection moderation
*   Transfer
    The project will involve the development of a server application and database to hold digital collections of brand names. We have already signed contracts with seven brands willing to digitize one item from their collections for inclusion in our initiative.
    The finished solution will contain all required production-ready features, such as data security and encryption, as well as, if necessary, at least two server applications operating for failover/redundancy.
    The first phase of the project will concentrate on server construction, 3D modeling (7 items), and UI/UX design,  while the second phase will involve integration with DCL API (or a possible way to connect directly).
    The objective is to expand the number of brands with wearable collections and content and to generate greater market activity by offering a vast selection of outfits and accessories.


## Personnel

With a team from the fashion, technology, and gaming industries, Seamm cultivates a space to create, experiment, and release inhibitions.
The software engineers that have already published two versions of our core application will be a part of the new service development team. The UI/UX designer has a portfolio of successful fashion brand projects. Our 3D artists have launched wearables collections on the DCL marketplace for brands and have experience creating 3D models that adhere to constraints and optimize all needs. Business Development - 20+ years in the fashion industry (e.g., Bottega Veneta, Moschino, TSUM).
Our crew is intimately familiar with the challenges that every brand has while designing collections for DCL. As players in DCL, our team members are familiar with the frustrations of consumers when the market for wearables is limited. Therefore, we are prepared to resolve this issue and propose a universal answer for both parties.


## Roadmap and milestones

Phase 1 features:

*   Collecting technical requirements for DCL API integration
*   UI/UX design and features
*   Creation of 3D-models (7 items)
    Total estimated time: 80 hours
    Phase 1 extra features:
*   Approve collection
*   Implementation of comments and fixing in the interface

Total estimated time: 20 hours

Phase 2 Features:

*   Transfer process and approve
*   Integration with DCL API
*   Publishing in the DCL marketplace

Total estimated time: 40 hours

Total Project Estimated 140 hours

Dev budget 40k
Design and 3D-artists budget 20k

62,8dcbf39b-7e20-464b-86f8-9278f7bce2f1,SNAPSHOT,Transition from a Dual-Token Economy to a Single-Token Economy Using Just $MAGIC,"This year's bear market has allowed us to review the dual-token model as used by popular games like Axie Infinity and we have come to the conclusion that a single-token economy would likely benefit Cosmic Universe more than a dual-token economy. 

Proposal: Transition from a Dual-Token Economy to a Single-Token Economy Using $MAGIC

-Transfer all use-cases currently assigned to COSMIC directly to MAGIC, thereby immediately increasing utility for MAGIC.
-Accurate COSMIC:MAGIC conversion ratio that burns COSMIC and provides the corresponding $ amount in MAGIC
-Reduce emissions for the COSMIC-USDC LP to zero, transferring its emissions to the MAGIC-WAVAX LP
-Replacing all uses for COSMIC in Dawn of Crypton Expeditions to MAGIC

Benefits of Switching to a Single-Token Economy (MAGIC):

-Concentrate liquidity into MAGIC LPs so that there is greater liquidity for MAGIC
-Significantly increase the number of use-cases for MAGIC
-Avoid game economy issues plaguing games like Axie Infinity
  - Never-ending fight for relevance of the secondary token
  - ""Play to Earn"" core definition of the secondary token
  - ""Loss of distinction"" created when defining true attribution of a task to its corresponding token
-Become more appealing to investors

We strongly believe transitioning to solely using MAGIC will benefit Cosmic Universe over the long-term, and this would be the ideal time to make such a change while the markets are the way they are and while we are small.

Voting Time: 30 Days

If the community governance vote passes, we will arrange for the COSMIC to MAGIC conversion to be done starting on January 1st, 2023 or a few days after given the holidays. Once the Bridge from Harmony to Avalanche is closed (December 31st, 2022), that is when we can activate the shift to a single-token economy. Anyone who has not migrated their NFT assets from Harmony to Avalanche by that point will still be able to receive their assets on Avalanche, so not to worry for those who never migrated, and we will provide more details on that process later this year. 

Note: This process has no bearing on Dawn of Crypton's initial release timeframe, as COSMIC was going to be used for Expeditions, not Elven Adventures which is being released first.",0x8af9b9bf23b3ade1362889f745c5008159dd4e40,2022-11-14T05:43:24.000Z,0x094f6fd16637db0b24081328a9558f73779ecd0443c77e27c92c3abb9b576a75,2022-12-14T05:36:42.000Z,ACTIVE,48,"{""Yes"":""["",""No"":""7""}",https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0x094f6fd16637db0b24081328a9558f73779ecd0443c77e27c92c3abb9b576a75,https://deepdao.io/user/0x8af9b9bf23b3ade1362889f745c5008159dd4e40/verified_dao_experience

**Summary:**

Once staking is made available on the SuperVerse website, the SuperVerse DAO Treasury will be used for the distribution of rewards to SuperVerse DAO members who are actively staking in the designated DAO pools. 

**Distribution of SuperVerse DAO Treasury Funds:**

The revenue split will be programmed and self-executing via a smart contract with the below allocation:

* **80% Community Rewards**
    * These funds will be redistributed as rewards to SuperVerse DAO members who are actively staking in the designated DAO pools
* **20% Ongoing Development and Maintenance**
    * A small portion of fees will be allocated to Super Studios for its continued contribution to the development and product maintenance of the SuperVerse ecosystem.

Additional details regarding the distribution and release of funds will be provided at a later date.

**Community Incentive:**

The goal of this proposal is to inform the community in the interests of transparency how the SuperVerse DAO Treasury funds will be distributed if the proposal is implemented. The SuperVerse DAO members and the SuperVerse ecosystem benefit directly from Super Studios products and the Super Studios team is receiving funding to continue to develop and maintain products to build out the ecosystem. 

**Rationale:**

The proposed structure provides a sustainable business model for all parties involved. 

**Specifications:**

Assuming SVIP-1 and SVIP-2 are approved:

* The SuperVerse DAO will create a smart contract to execute the revenue split
* The SuperVerse DAO will conduct a smart contract audit

**Steps to Implement:**

* Staking goes live on the SuperVerse website
* Distribution mechanism finalized

### SVIP-1: Proposing the DAO

**Category:** Process and Informational

**Submitted By**: Thare

**Summary:**

This document proposes the structure of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governed by $SUPER holders staking within the designated DAO pools. 

**Community Incentive:**

The SuperVerse DAO community will have the power to submit proposals and vote on the ideas they feel are most beneficial for the project.

 The guiding values of the SuperVerse DAO are:

* Equality: One staked $SUPER = one vote.
* Transparency: We create a process that is clear and visible to our community.
* Collective Responsibility: We act in the best interest of the future of the project.
* Innovation: We strive to inspire the next trend.

**Rationale:**

The SuperVerse DAO is a community of Web3 enthusiasts who are inspired by a common vision. SuperVerse DAO governance empowers $SUPER token holders by letting them have a say in the future of the project. To make this a successful process, it is critical to have active participation from all of the members of the DAO. We rely on community initiative to thrive in idea submission, general feedback, proposal submission, and voting. Transparency is a guiding value for the SuperVerse DAO and with that in mind, all parts of the governance process will be visible to the DAO members.

**Membership Eligibility:**

The only requirement for membership in the DAO is staking $SUPER token within the designated DAO pools on the SuperVerse website. Staking $SUPER token allows participation in proposal ideation, general community discussion, and voting on proposals. Participating in proposal submission is restricted to SuperVerse DAO members that stake at least 15,000 $SUPER within the designated DAO pools.

**Guidelines**

1. Every year, there is a DAO-wide vote to determine which DAO members will serve on a special council for the SuperVerse DAO (the Special Council). The purpose of the Special Council is to administer DAO proposals and serve the vision of the community.
2. A Special Council member may be removed and replaced prior to the term pursuant to a majority vote of token holders. 
3. The total cost of implementation must be clear in order for a proposal to get voted on.
4. DAO members must search past proposals to ensure any idea they intend to write a proposal for has not already been submitted.
5. If a suggested proposal is in direct conflict with a proposal that is currently up for a vote, the second proposal should not be voted on until a decision is made on the first proposal to avoid approval of opposing requirements.
6. A suggested proposal that is in direct conflict with another approved proposal cannot get voted on for three months after the original proposal has been implemented to avoid wasting community assets.
7. Proposals will not be considered or put up for a vote if they involve illegal activity, hate speech, pornographic material, or are at odds with the mission or values of the SuperVerse DAO.

**The Process**

**Proposal Phases**

Phase One: SVIP Idea

An idea is submitted by the community as a post in the forum. The person or persons submitting the SVIP idea are the SVIP Authors. More than one DAO member can work on an SVIP idea, but it should only be submitted once. The community then has the opportunity to provide feedback via comments on the forum. The SVIP Authors can propose changes to the original idea, but only through comments on the forum. To keep discussions transparent, the SVIP Authors may not change the original post.

Phase Two: SVIP Draft

When SVIP Authors determine they have enough information to draft a proposal, an admin engaged by SuperVerse will close the topic on the forum and send the proposal template to the SVIP Authors along with the next steps for submission. The SVIP Authors should consider including any community feedback that furthers the idea as part of their draft before continuing. The admin may inform the SVIP Authors of any necessary changes required to comply with the DAO-approved guidelines. At this time, an  SVIP Author will be required to authenticate their wallet to prove they have met the staking requirements for submitting a proposal. If the SVIP Authors do not respond to all requests from the admin within 30 days, the SVIP draft will be automatically rejected. If and when the admin confirms the SVIP draft complies with the DAO-approved guidelines, a number will be assigned to the SVIP for identification purposes. From that point on, the SVIP is referred to as “SVIP-#; (Name) - (Category)”. For example, this first SVIP is “SVIP-1: Proposing the DAO - Process and Informational”.

Phase Three: SVIP Analysis Report and Moderation

The SVIP Draft is reviewed by an admin team engaged by SuperVerse. The admin team will analyze the proposal and provide a report detailing costs, steps to implement, legal considerations, third-party review requirements, potential conflicts of interest, and any further complications that have been identified. Knowing that some SVIP Authors may be submitting drafts with little to no resources, this phase is important to ensure that DAO members have enough information about proposals to make informed decisions when voting. During this time, the admin team also decides if the proposal adheres to the DAO-approved guidelines. If approved, it becomes a Pending SVIP and moves to Phase Four. If not approved, it is eligible for resubmission except in extreme circumstances. SVIP's that violate the law, include misleading information, or have reasonable suspicion of fraud will not be eligible for resubmission.

Phase Four: SVIP Designation

Pending SVIPs that have passed SVIP Moderation are designated as “Ready to Vote” or “Needs Administrative Review”.

The “Ready to Vote” designation is given to a pending SVIP whose details meet the proposal criteria and are of no risk to the well-being of the DAO. Any Pending SVIP that is designated as “Ready to Vote” will go to the board for final approval. If final approval is given by the board, skip to Phase Six. In a case where the board does not approve the Pending SVIP, clear rationale will be provided to the SVIP Authors of the proposal and the proposal will be eligible for resubmission.

The “Needs Administrative Review” designation is given to a Pending SVIP whose costs, content, or implications are considered complicated or a potential risk to the well-being of the DAO. Any Pending SVIP that is designated as “Needs Administrative Review” must go through Phase Five.

Phase Five: SVIP Admin Review (If Applicable)

For Pending SVIPs that have been designated as “Needs Administrative Review,” the Board will determine whether clarification or action is required before moving a Pending SVIP to Phase Six. If clarification or action is not needed, the Pending SVIP is designated as “Approved for Voting” and proceeds to Phase Six. If the Board decides to return a Pending SVIP for further clarification or action, they must provide a clear explanation of why and designate it as either “Return for Clarification” or “Return for Reconstruction.”

Reasons to tag as “Return for Clarification” may include, but are not limited to:

* The cost to implement is unclear or not able to be calculated
* The proposal would use more than 5% of the DAO treasury
* The proposal conflicts with another proposal

Reasons to tag as “Return for Reconstruction” may include but are not limited to:

* The proposal conflicts with the mission and values of the DAO
* The proposal is at odds with the well-being of the DAO
* Violations of law, or against the advice of counsel for Super Foundation
* Reasonable suspicion of fraud or other misleading information

Phase Six: SVIP Vote

Drafts that have passed their respective approval processes will go live for voting on Snapshot. Once live on Snapshot, SVIPs are open to voting for six days. SuperVerse admins are the only ones that can post SVIPs to the voting tool, because they must confirm that each one has gone through the correct approval process.

Phase Seven: SVIP Determination

If a live SVIP vote has not received the minimum engagement of 5% of the circulating supply of $SUPER or at least 60% of the total votes “in favor” of the proposal, it will be designated as “Stalled” and be eligible for Resubmission. In all other cases, SVIPs are moved to one of two Final SVIP categories. Rejected Final SVIPs can be resubmitted via the appropriate Resubmission Template if the SVIP Author contacts an admin. Accepted Final SVIPs move into SVIP Implementation.

Phase Eight: SVIP Implementation

For Accepted Final SVIPs, implementation will begin based on the steps outlined in the SVIP template. The admin engaged by the Super Foundation is responsible for ensuring this happens, but is not responsible for doing it themselves.

Proposal Conflicts

If a suggested proposal directly conflicts with a proposal that is currently up for a vote, the second proposal should not go for a vote until a decision is made on the first proposal to avoid approval of opposing requirements.

A suggested proposal that directly conflicts with another approved proposal cannot go to vote for three months after the original proposal has been implemented to avoid wasting community assets.

**Specifications**

The SuperVerse website is home to all things for the SuperVerse DAO. The website is the access point to all relevant information such as the SuperVerse DAO governance process and all the systems or tools that are part of the SuperVerse DAO ecosystem. 

Communication Channel: The forum platform (Phase One)

* SVIP Idea posts must be approved by an admin to ensure they meet all predetermined guidelines and template requirements.
* All posts and comments will be regularly monitored by both an admin engaged by the SuperVerse DAO and by the DAO community members themselves.
* The SVIP Authors of an SVIP idea share their idea via a post in the forum and cannot edit the original post. If the SVIP Authors want to propose changes to the original SVIP Idea, the SVIP Authors must do this via the comments.
* Once SVIP Authors determine they have enough information for a proposal, SVIP Ideas threads are closed to community feedback and will be locked by an admin.

Process for SVIP Draft Submission via SVIP Template: (Phase Two)

* Once an SVIP Idea is locked in the forum, after the community feedback period, an admin will contact the SVIP Author to provide the appropriate SVIP Template.
* The SVIP Author should then submit an official SVIP Draft to the admin using the SVIP Template.
* The admin may then continue communication with the SVIP Author to inform them of any incorrect or missing information that needs to be changed—or clarifications that need to be made— for the SVIP Draft to move to the next step.
* If the SVIP Author does not respond to an admin’s request to change, update, or make clarifications on the SVIP Draft within 30 days, the SVIP Draft will be automatically rejected.

Platform where live SVIPs are Hosted: Snapshot (Phase Six)

* SuperVerse DAO members must go through a wallet authentication process to vote on Snapshot.
* SuperVerse admins are the only ones allowed to launch SVIPs on Snapshot, as they must ensure each SVIP has gone through the correct approval process.
* See SVIP-2 for further details on the proposed SVIP Vote mechanics.

 **Steps to Implement**

* Complete setup of forum and settings
* Assign administrators of the forum
* Assign reviewers to prepare reports for implications of proposals
* Assign admins to review proposals
* Assign special council
* Set up Snapshot space
* Whitelist admin wallets to submit proposals
* Create custom token-gating solution for the forum
* Add Wallet Connect support to the token-gating solution for the forum

 **Timeline**

All steps have been prepared and are ready to be implemented.

 **Overall Cost**

SuperVerse DAO will provide a kitty to bankroll the initial costs of the DAO to a value of $250,000.00. This will be used to cover domain purchases and related costs, legal fees, DAO administration setup, forum platform maintenance, and miscellaneous out-of-pocket costs. This will also be used to hire resources (admins) to operate the DAO for the first 12 months.",0x3ff4a23987100c7af2bcc003e45b039e4ad69270,2022-11-29T19:48:36.000Z,0x7730e987eef9fcf4f34ffa26206957c8b8cb9a55bfaeb6c01b2fd4a27ded22f9,2022-12-05T20:00:00.000Z,ACTIVE,47,"{""In favor"":""["",""Against"":""2""}",https://deepdao.io/feed-proposal/0x7730e987eef9fcf4f34ffa26206957c8b8cb9a55bfaeb6c01b2fd4a27ded22f9,https://deepdao.io/user/0x3ff4a23987100c7af2bcc003e45b039e4ad69270/verified_dao_experience

76,53e01efd-2aec-43b0-a258-6f8704f19a02,SNAPSHOT,SVIP-2: Voting,"### SVIP-2: Voting

**Category:** Process and Informational

**Submitted By:** Thare

**Summary:**

This document proposes the voting protocol for the DAO outlined in SVIP-1. Snapshot.org will be used initially for voting on improvement proposals. Proposals that have followed the respective guidelines and have been approved will be available for voting on Snapshot.

**Community Incentive:**

The goal of this proposal is to create voting infrastructure for SuperVerse DAO members to participate in the decision-making of the DAO. That is why Snapshot is proposed as the voting tool for the SuperVerse DAO. The benefits of the proposed voting system are:

* not requiring a gas payment
* ensuring transparency
* expanding governance participation to all SuperVerse DAO members

Without a voting system in place, arriving at a consensus on proposals would be centralized, with only a few people holding decision-making abilities. This proposal aims to avoid this result.

**Rationale:**

As the ecosystem evolves and expands, a well-defined system is required to gather new community ideas and provide a clear path for these ideas to be approved for implementation. A proposal process is foundational to this system becoming a reality. This proposal outlines a voting tool that seeks to balance the pros and cons of various voting approaches and to hold up the core of the SuperVerse DAO’s guiding values. This voting tool can be found below in the following specifications section.

**Specifications**

Assuming SVIP-1 is approved, implement Snapshot as the voting tool for the SuperVerse DAO where:

* Only SuperVerse DAO members may vote
* New SVIPs that meet the required guidelines will be put to a community vote
* The voting opens immediately upon posting and is open for six days
* The voting options for a live SVIP are “In favor” and “Against.” Voting “In favor” means the voter is in favor of implementing the SVIP exactly as-is. Voting “Against” means the vote is against implementing the SVIP exactly as-is — one may vote “Against” to encourage the SVIP Author to resubmit the SVIP after making changes.
* If a live SVIP Vote has not received the minimum engagement of 5% of the circulating supply of $SUPER or at least 60% of the total votes “in favor” of the proposal, it will be designated as “Stalled” and be eligible for Resubmission
* Proposals that are approved by the members of the DAO are implemented by the SuperVerse DAO
* Only SuperVerse admins can post SVIPs to Snapshot because they must ensure that each one has gone through the correct approvals process

**Steps to Implement**

* Complete setup of the forum platform and settings
* Purchase ENS domain
* Create specific space on Snapshot
* Implement ecosystem-specific voting strategy
* Set administrator addresses
* Set voting rules
* Set restrictions in Snapshot so that only admins can launch proposals
* Open ratification of SVIP-1 and SVIP-2

A lot of users buy crypto on CEX.. but we all know what can happen..
So maybe we should consider adding an on ramp directly on pancakeswap.

A great tool is provided by the swiss intermediary mtpelerin.com

No KYC requiered

Direct links, iFrame or modal
React Native package


I think a tool like that would help not only pancakeswap but whole crypto world.

check the simple integration tool on it's site.. they have gread options Eth and L2.. so it's also applicable on other chains where pancakeswap is live.

I don't work for mtpelerin.com but i'm using it when i want to on-or-off-ramp every time since i discovered it.

I have found out how to solve this problem. 

# •First of all you can disable opportunity to take part in IFO if person voted ,,NO'' in voting. 
It will decrease quantity of people who will take part in IFO. And increase quantity of holders  who really intresting in project. it will do the voting more valuable and responsible. In other hand those who want to ruin ifo will be less valuable.

The one thing we can say is our vision is alive and although we aren’t as active we will find ways, successful or not, to try and propel this. 


Please note we want what will be best for the community, even if that means passing the project off to the community. Should that be the final decision from the community, which we suspect is, we will still play a role because we want to take a role in the chimp fam flourishing. 

OPTION #2 - PASSING THE PROJECT TO THE COMMUNITY: The CryptoChimpz Team will hand off the project to someone (individual or collective) in the community and step down to - lesser involved advisory roles. We do need to be clear about the structure should this option be most voted. 

⁃	The individual or group of individuals chosen to take over the project will be chosen by our team for the protection of the community. We will choose the new operators from #bod and make sure they adhere to a strict criteria to mitigate any risks transferring ownership comes with.
⁃	The new operator or operators are free to change the structure of this project. We do however want most larger decisions to be made as a community. 
⁃	To help support the community we will allocate some funds for marketing. We will be transferring these to the new operators of the project. The new operators will be responsible for utilizing these funds to propel the project. 28% of all secondary sales will be withheld and paid out to our silent investor, the remainder will be transferred to the new operators upon which they can utilize funds in ways they see best.
⁃	All social media accounts will be transferred to the new operators.
⁃	The founders roles after successful transfer will be discussed with the new operators. Regardless of what roles we help with, the founders will be on standby for any questions or issues the new operators may have.

Please cast your vote by DEC 18th 2022…
